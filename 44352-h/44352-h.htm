<br />THE SILVER FOX</h2>
<p>&ldquo;And then I saw it&mdash;the Shadow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The speaker&rsquo;s eyes appeared to snap.
Johnny Thompson leaned forward in his chair.
&ldquo;It glided through the fog without a sound.&rdquo;
The voice droned on, &ldquo;Not a sound, mind you!
We had a small boat with powerful motors.
I stepped on the gas. Our motors roared. We
were after that shadow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And then?&rdquo; Johnny Thompson whispered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;For all I know,&rdquo; the black-eyed man murmured,
leaning back in his chair, &ldquo;we might
have cut that shadow square in two. Anyway,
that&rsquo;s the last we saw of it for that day.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But think of it!&rdquo; he exclaimed after a second&rsquo;s
pause. &rdquo;Think of the thing just disappearing
in the fog like that!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_12">[12]</div>
<p>He was a romantic figure, this man Blackie.
The boys of Matanuska Valley in Alaska loved
this gathering of an evening about the red-hot
stove in the store. And no part of the evening&rsquo;s
entertainment was ever half so thrilling as
Blackie&rsquo;s stories.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was spring then,&rdquo; Blackie added, &ldquo;late
May, when the salmon run was on.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was a whale after salmon, that shadow,&rdquo;
someone suggested.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, sir!&rdquo; Blackie fairly shouted. &ldquo;It was
too fast for a whale! Some sort of Oriental
craft, I shouldn&rsquo;t wonder. Though how they&rsquo;d
make it go without a sound is beyond me.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah well,&rdquo; he sighed, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll be rid of these
by spring.&rdquo; He kicked at the crutches beside
his chair. &ldquo;Then I&rsquo;ll be after &rsquo;em again, those
bloomin&rsquo; Orientals and their gliding shadows.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You going back into the Coast Guard Service?&rdquo;
Johnny asked eagerly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I sure am!&rdquo; Blackie agreed heartily.
&ldquo;Boy! That&rsquo;s the life! A speedy boat with
two or three airplane motors in her hull, a good
crew, plenty of gas, the wide open sea and
enough trouble to keep your eyes open day and
night. Man! Oh, man!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_13">[13]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Take me along,&rdquo; Johnny suggested impulsively.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Me too!&rdquo; put in Lawrence, his slim, bright-eyed
cousin.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you know about boats?&rdquo; Blackie
asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Plenty,&rdquo; was Johnny&rsquo;s prompt reply. &ldquo;Been
on &rsquo;em all my life, power boats on the Great
Lakes, Carib Indian sailboats in the Caribbean,
skin-boats way up north. It&rsquo;s all the same.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And Lawrence here,&rdquo; he added after a brief
pause, &ldquo;he knows about motors.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&mdash;I was assistant mechanic in an airplane
hangar for a season,&rdquo; Lawrence agreed modestly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, it&mdash;might&mdash;be&mdash;arranged,&rdquo; Blackie
replied slowly. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t know about pay. You
sort of have to be on regular for that. But up
here in the north, things can&rsquo;t always be done
according to department regulations. Anyway,
it&rsquo;s worth thinking about.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_14">[14]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Thank&mdash;oh, thank you,&rdquo; Lawrence stammered.
Johnny knew how he was feeling at
that moment. He, Johnny, had met adventure
in many climes. Lawrence had lived a quiet
life. Really to sail on a coast guard boat in
search of Orientals suspected of stealing salmon,
smuggling or spying off the Alaskan
shores, to chase gray shadows that pass in the
fog! Worth thinking of? Well, you&rsquo;d just
know it was!</p>
<p>Johnny was still thinking of all this when
two hours later, he crept beneath the blankets
in the small log cabin room occupied by Lawrence
and himself.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That would be great!&rdquo; he was telling himself.
In fancy, he allowed his mind to wander.
Bristol Bay, a hundred and fifty miles wide
and a hundred and fifty long, fishing boats on
the water, canneries on the shore and back
behind all this in the fog somewhere, beyond
the three-mile line, great dark bulks that were
Oriental ships. Why these ships? No one
knew exactly. &ldquo;Spying out our shore-line,&rdquo;
some said, &ldquo;stealing our salmon,&rdquo; said others.
And perhaps they were smugglers. It was
known that these ships carried smaller crafts
that could be lowered to the water. &ldquo;Could do
anything, go anywhere, these small boats,&rdquo;
Johnny assured himself.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_15">[15]</div>
<p>&ldquo;And the Shadow, that mysterious gray
form that goes streaking through the fog.
What could it be?</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, well,&ldquo; he settled deeper among the blankets.
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a long time till spring, and here, right
in Matanuska Valley is exciting adventure
aplenty.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As if reading his thoughts, Lawrence murmured
dreamily, &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll go after him again
tomorrow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; Johnny agreed, &ldquo;tomorrow.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="tb">&ldquo;Lawrence! Look! There he is!&rdquo; Johnny
pointed excitedly up the glistening expanse of
frozen river. Tomorrow had come. They
were on the river.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wh&mdash;where?&rdquo; Lawrence whispered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t have to whisper.&rdquo; Johnny
laughed low. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s way up there. I can scarcely
see him with the glass. Here! Take it. See
that pool of water on the right side?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes&mdash;yes, I see.&rdquo; Lawrence took the field
glasses.</p>
<p>&ldquo;At this end of that pool. I saw him move.
Look quick!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_16">[16]</div>
<p>For a space of ten seconds Lawrence studied
that pool. &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he exclaimed at last, &ldquo;he <i>is</i>
there! I saw him move over to the right.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lawrence!&rdquo; Johnny&rsquo;s voice was tense with
emotion. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m going after him!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Johnny bent over to tighten a skate strap.
&ldquo;Here! Give me the bag. You follow me, but
not too fast. You can keep the glasses. I
won&rsquo;t need them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Al&mdash;all right, Johnny. Be careful! You&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>But Johnny was away. Skating from the
hips, scarcely lifting a foot from the ice, he
appeared to glide without effort over the glass-like
surface of the river.</p>
<p>The boy&rsquo;s spirits rose. They were &ldquo;after
him again.&rdquo; And &ldquo;he&rdquo; was a grand prize
indeed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If only we can get him,&rdquo; Johnny was thinking.
&ldquo;If we only can.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The distant future quite forgotten, Johnny
was living intensely in the glorious present.
Lawrence followed slowly. He, too, was a
skillful skater. The river at this point was
frozen solidly. No need for thought here.
At once his mind was busy with memories of
the not-too-distant past and plans for the future.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_17">[17]</div>
<p>Life for him had been strange. Eight
months before he had been on the broad, dry
prairies of the Dakotas. Now he was skating
on the Matanuska River in Alaska. Nor was
this just an adventurous winter trip. The
Matanuska Valley was his home and would be,
he hoped, for years to come. Six miles back
and up a half mile from the river was their
claim and the sod-covered log cabin they
called home.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We are pioneers!&rdquo; he whispered to himself.
&ldquo;Pioneers!&rdquo; he repeated softly. How he loved
that word. How much it meant to them all;
freedom, new life, fresh hope and in the end
a home all their own. &ldquo;And paid for,&rdquo; he declared
sturdily.</p>
<p>Yes, when the government had announced
a resettlement project in this rich valley and
the Lawsons who had been driven from their
farm home by drouth and dust heard of it
they had joined up. And here they were:
father, mother and son, with cousin Johnny
thrown in for good measure.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_18">[18]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Been here six months,&rdquo; Lawrence thought.
&ldquo;Got a little start. And next year!&rdquo; Ah, yes,
next year. His face sobered. So much depended
on the future. And they needed so many
things.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll not go in debt,&rdquo; his father had insisted
stoutly. &ldquo;Not for a single thing we can
do without.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But now the boy&rsquo;s mind came back with a
snap to the immediate present. As he looked
ahead he saw nothing of Johnny. For a second
his heart fluttered. Had his good pal come
upon an unsuspected air-hole? Had he gone
through? Was he, at this moment, caught by
the swift current, shooting along rapidly beneath
the ice?</p>
<p>&ldquo;You have to know your river,&rdquo; an old-timer
had said to them. &ldquo;Every foot of it.&rdquo;
Did Johnny know it well enough, or&mdash;</p>
<p>Of a sudden he let out a low, happy laugh.
Some distance ahead, showing among the
branches of a fallen fir tree, he had caught a
glimpse of Johnny&rsquo;s plaid mackinaw.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&mdash;he&rsquo;s all right,&rdquo; he breathed. &ldquo;Just
getting a look.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_19">[19]</div>
<p>Johnny was now within a hundred yards
of that dark pool, where, he hoped, their prize
still lurked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He must see him with the naked eye,&rdquo;
Lawrence murmured as he glided into the
shadow of a shelving bank. Here, steadying
himself with one hand, he held the glass to
his eyes with the other.</p>
<p>Then, with hand trembling so it seemed the
glass would drop, he exclaimed, &ldquo;Man! Oh,
man! It&rsquo;s a silver fox and a beauty! If only
he gets him! If he does!&rdquo;</p>
<p>They were hunters, these boys. &ldquo;Strange
hunters!&rdquo; some might say. &ldquo;No guns! No
traps!&rdquo; This valley was alive with rich, fur-bearing
animals. With guns and traps one
might reap a winter&rsquo;s harvest. Without guns
or traps how was it to be done! This had
been the question uppermost in their minds
some weeks before. In the end they had found
the answer, or thought they had. And a
strange answer it was.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_20">[20]</div>
<p>They had arrived, this little family of four
homesteaders, along with hundreds of others
in the Matanuska Valley, too late in the spring
to clear land and raise a crop. They had been
obliged to content themselves with a large
garden and an acre of potatoes.</p>
<p>Such potatoes as those had been! &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll
sell two hundred bushels!&rdquo; Lawrence had
exulted. &ldquo;That will go a long way toward
buying a small tractor. Then just watch our
smoke!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, no you won&rsquo;t!&rdquo; Jack Morgan, an old-time
settler in the valley, had laughed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What? Why not?&rdquo; the boy demanded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who&rsquo;ll you sell &rsquo;em to?&rdquo; the old-timer
asked in a kindly voice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, we&mdash;we&rsquo;ll ship &rsquo;em out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You can&rsquo;t, son,&rdquo; Jack&rsquo;s voice rumbled.
&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the trouble. At present there&rsquo;s no
market for farm products here. Never has
been. That&rsquo;ll be worked out in time, now the
government is interested. But just now we
have to eat our own potatoes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But how do you get any money?&rdquo; Lawrence
had demanded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Trap foxes, minks, martin. Good money
in trappin&rsquo;,&rdquo; was the old-timer&rsquo;s reply.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_21">[21]</div>
<p>Of course, the boys had come rushing home
bursting with the news that they could make
money all winter long trapping.</p>
<p>To their surprise they saw Lawrence&rsquo;s father&rsquo;s
smiling face draw into sober lines.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, boys,&rdquo; he said quietly. &ldquo;Not that. Anything
but trapping. It&rsquo;s too cruel. I&rsquo;d rather
you went out with a gun.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But we haven&rsquo;t a gun,&rdquo; Lawrence protested.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right,&rdquo; the father agreed. &ldquo;And
it&rsquo;s not to be regretted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You see, boys,&rdquo; his face took on a strange
look, &ldquo;when I was about ten years old I had
a dog I thought the world and all of. He
didn&rsquo;t cost a lot of money. Never won any
prizes at dog shows. But his hair was kinky,
his eyes alive with fun and his bark a joyous
sound to hear. No boy ever had a more faithful
friend than good old Bing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And then,&rdquo; his voice grew husky, &ldquo;well,
you see there was a man who lived all by himself
down by the river, Skunk McGee they
called him. Never amounted to much, he
didn&rsquo;t. But he trapped enough skunks and
muskrats to pay for his groceries.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_22">[22]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Our farm was along the river, on both
sides. Father told him more than once not to
set his traps on our farm.</p>
<p>&ldquo;One time in the dead of winter, way down
below zero, old Bing didn&rsquo;t come home. I was
worried but father said, &lsquo;He&rsquo;s gone to the
neighbors and they took him in on account of
its being so cold.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But he hadn&rsquo;t,&rdquo; Mr. Lawson&rsquo;s tone
changed abruptly. &ldquo;He was in one of Skunk
McGee&rsquo;s traps. And when we found him he
was dead, frozen hard as a rock.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And so you see, boys,&rdquo; he added quietly,
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve always hated traps. I never see one even
now but I seem to see poor old Bing with
one foot in it, whining and shivering out there
all alone.&rdquo;</p>
<p>From that day on the thought of traps was
banished from their minds.</p>
<p>But the foxes? Did they vanish? No indeed!
The foxes saw to it that they were not
forgotten.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_23">[23]</div>
<p>Before the summer was at an end some
families, unaccustomed to the pioneer life,
lost courage and decided to return to their
original homes. Among these were two families
who had brought with them small flocks
of chickens. By careful planning the Lawsons
were able to buy the chickens. Having built
a stout log henhouse and a small wire enclosure
for sunny days, they felt better than
ever prepared for the winter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Chicken for Thanksgiving and Christmas
and eggs all winter long! What luck!&rdquo; Lawrence
rejoiced.</p>
<p>The chickens, no doubt, were something of
a surprise to the foxes. But had they not
always preyed upon ptarmigan? And were
not chickens just big plump ptarmigan? Perhaps
this was the way they reasoned. At any
rate, one night Lawrence heard a loud squawking
and rushed out just in time to see a plump
white hen vanish into the night. A fox had her
by the neck.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Something must be done about that,&rdquo; he
insisted at once. &ldquo;If we can&rsquo;t trap the foxes,
what then?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Take them alive,&rdquo; was his father&rsquo;s prompt
reply.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Alive! Alive!&rdquo; both boys cried.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_24">[24]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t see why not,&rdquo; was Lawrence&rsquo;s father&rsquo;s
quiet reply. &ldquo;Of course, you&rsquo;ll have to
wear tough, moose-hide mittens and keep your
noses out of reach, but&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll do it,&rdquo; Lawrence exclaimed. &ldquo;But
then,&rdquo; his face sobered, &ldquo;how&rsquo;ll we ever catch
up with a fox?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;When I was a boy,&rdquo; said his father, &ldquo;we
used to catch muskrats on skates.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Muskrats on skates?&rdquo; Lawrence laughed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We were on the skates,&rdquo; his father corrected
with a smile. &ldquo;The rats were on the ice,
you see,&rdquo; he leaned forward. &ldquo;We worked it
this way. We&rsquo;d watch until the muskrat
came out of his hole to get a drink. He&rsquo;d go
to an open pool of water at the edge of the
ice. We&rsquo;d wait until he&rsquo;d started back across
the ice. Then we&rsquo;d come swooping down on
him. He&rsquo;d get frightened and sprawl all over
the ice&mdash;no wild creature can handle himself
well on the ice. So we had him.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_25">[25]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Once,&rdquo; he chuckled, &ldquo;Bob Barnett saw
something moving on the ice. It was just getting
dark. He thought it was a rat. He come
swooping down upon it and&mdash;&rdquo; he paused to
chuckle. &ldquo;Well, it turned out to be a skunk.
The skunk objected to his intrusion. So Bob
went home to bury his clothes&mdash;just for a
scent.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The boys joined in the laugh that followed
but they were not slow in following this suggestion.
They found, however, that great skill
and caution were needed in this type of hunting.</p>
<p>They made progress slowly. After catching
two muskrats, a snow-shoe rabbit and two
ground-squirrels, they decided to start a small
zoo all their own.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who knows?&rdquo; Lawrence enthused. &ldquo;We
may catch some truly rare creature. The keepers
of zoos are always on the lookout for live
specimens. We may sell enough to get that
bright new tractor down at Palmer after all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A tractor!&rdquo; Johnny doubted. &ldquo;Oh! No!
Surely not that much!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_26">[26]</div>
<p>&ldquo;And yet,&rdquo; Lawrence now thought as he
stood watching for Johnny&rsquo;s next move on the
river ice, &ldquo;there he is creeping up on a silver
fox. What is a real, live silver fox worth?&rdquo;
To this exciting question he could form no
accurate answer. He had a hazy recollection
of reading somewhere about one that was sold
for $3000.00.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No such luck as that,&rdquo; he whispered.</p>
<p>Just now, however, his attention was directed
toward the silver fox that, still very
much at liberty, had taken a good drink from
the pool and was standing, nose in air, apparently
looking, listening, smelling. Had he
smelled trouble? Would he drop into the pool
to swim across and disappear on the farther
bank, or would he start back across that glistening
stretch of ice? Lawrence felt his heart
leap as he saw the fox drop his head. The big
moment was at hand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&mdash;he&rsquo;s going across!&rdquo; he exclaimed in
a hoarse whisper. &ldquo;It means so much!&rdquo; His
thoughts went into a tailspin. Not only would
they possess a real, live silver fox for which,
beyond doubt, some zoo would pay handsomely,
but their flock of chickens would be
safe, for they could tell by the size of the
tracks that he was the one that was getting
the chickens. He was a sly one, indeed, this
fox. Three times in the last month, in spite
of their every effort to prevent it, he had carried
off a fat old hen.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_27">[27]</div>
<p>&ldquo;He&mdash;Johnny&rsquo;s starting,&rdquo; Lawrence said,
as, gliding silently from cover, he prepared to
follow his cousin on his swift, silent, breathless
quest.</p>
<p>It was a truly wonderful sight, those two
boys moving as if pushed by an unseen hand
closer, ever closer to the unsuspecting fox.</p>
<p>Moving swiftly, Johnny reached a fallen cottonwood
tree. Just then the fox, pausing in
his course, once more sniffed the air. &ldquo;I might
get him if I rushed him now,&rdquo; he thought,
&ldquo;and I might miss.&rdquo; This was true. The fox
was but a third of the way across the ice. He
was still too close to the pool. The plan was
to allow him to reach the very center of the
river, then to rush him. Startled, he would
start quickly for some shore. Losing all sense
of caution, he would begin to sprawl upon
the ice. As the boy came rushing on with the
speed of the wind, he would stoop over, snatch
at the fox and speed on. He must seize the
fox just back of his ears. Could he do it? As
he stood there hidden his pulse pounded madly.
He, too, had seen that it was a silver fox.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_28">[28]</div>
<p>&ldquo;He&mdash;he&rsquo;s smelled me!&rdquo; The boy&rsquo;s voice
rose in a sudden shrill shout. &ldquo;Come on, Lawrence!
I&rsquo;m going after him! Bring the bag!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Gripping a large, moose-hide sack, Lawrence
went speeding after him.</p>
<p>As for Johnny, with breath-taking suddenness,
he saw the distance between him and
the fox fade. A hundred yards, fifty, twenty,
and&mdash;&ldquo;Now!&rdquo; he breathed. &ldquo;Now!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The fox was not a foot from the edge of
the pool when, still speeding wildly, the boy
bent down and made one wild grab.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Got him!&rdquo; he shouted exultantly. But
wait! Ten seconds more and the fox&rsquo;s ivory
teeth were flashing in his very face. He seemed
to feel them tearing at his nose. There was
nothing to do but drop him. With a suddenness,
startling even to the fox, the boy let go.</p>
<p>Down dropped the fox. On sped the boy.
When Lawrence reached the spot the fox
had vanished into a hole and Johnny was
skating slowly, mournfully back.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Never mind,&rdquo; Lawrence consoled. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll
get him another time.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_29">[29]</div>
<p>&ldquo;But a silver fox and a beauty!&rdquo; Johnny
exclaimed. &ldquo;Think of losing him!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have thought.&rdquo; Lawrence was able to
grin in spite of his disappointment. &ldquo;It would
have meant a lot and now&mdash;&rdquo; he chuckled,
&ldquo;now we know it&rsquo;s a real silver fox after our
chickens. We&rsquo;ll have to lock them in a vault.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not as bad as that,&rdquo; said Johnny. &ldquo;But
Lawrence,&rdquo; his voice dropped. &ldquo;This must remain
a deep secret. Not a word to anyone.
If Jim and Jack Mayhorn knew about this
there&rsquo;d be a trap on every foot of the river.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Never a word,&rdquo; Lawrence agreed.</p>
<p>They were a rather disconsolate pair as they
pulled off their skates a half hour later.</p>
<p>&ldquo;To think!&rdquo; Johnny groaned. &ldquo;I had my
hands on five hundred dollars, perhaps a thousand
dollars worth of fox and had to drop
it because it was too hot.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The price of a tractor,&rdquo; Lawrence agreed.
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s too bad.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was too bad indeed. All day, five days
in the week, they worked hard at clearing
land. The trees were coming down. After
the spring thaw thousands of stumps must
be pulled. A tractor would do that work.
After that it would draw the plows.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_30">[30]</div>
<p>&ldquo;If only I hadn&rsquo;t lost him!&rdquo; Johnny groaned.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Aw! Forget it!&rdquo; Lawrence exclaimed.
&ldquo;Come on! Let&rsquo;s go home by the camp.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The &ldquo;camp,&rdquo; as they had come to call it,
was a three-sided shelter built on a corner of
their forty-acre claim. It had been built, and
apparently abandoned, only a few months before
their arrival. Such a snug shelter was
it that the boys had often sought its protection
from storms. Once, with a roaring fire
before its open side, they had spent a night
sleeping on its bed of evergreen boughs.</p>
<p>The place never lost its fascination. Who
had built it? Trader, hunter, trapper or gold
prospector? To this question they could form
no answer. Would he some day return? To
this, strangely enough on this very afternoon
they were to discover the answer, at least that
which appeared to be the answer. As they
were looking it over for the twentieth time
Lawrence suddenly exclaimed, &ldquo;Look! Here&rsquo;s
a bit of cloth tacked to this post. And there&rsquo;s
a note written on it in indelible ink!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_31">[31]</div>
<p>Johnny did look. &ldquo;Read it!&rdquo; he exclaimed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will,&rdquo; Lawrence began to read. &ldquo;Can&rsquo;t
quite make it out,&rdquo; he murmured. &ldquo;Oh, yes,
this is it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;I WILL BE BACK ON JULY 1st.
BILL.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So he&rsquo;s coming back,&rdquo; Johnny&rsquo;s tone was
strange.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Coming back,&rdquo; Lawrence agreed. &ldquo;All
right, Bill, old boy,&rdquo; he laughed. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll keep
your snug little camp ship-shape till you arrive.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And for this bit of service, had they but
known it, they were to receive a very unusual
reward.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_32">[32]</div>
<h2 id="c2"><span class="small">CHAPTER II</span>
<br />BLACKIE&rsquo;S STORY</h2>
<p>&ldquo;Tell us how you got that game leg of
yours, Blackie,&rdquo; Joe Lawrence, the
Palmer store-keeper, said to Blackie, as they
all sat about the roaring steel-barrel stove
three nights later.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, that&mdash;&rdquo; Blackie did not reply at once.</p>
<p>Johnny and Lawrence were by the fire.
They had walked in from the claim, a frosty
three miles, with the thermometer at twenty-five
degrees below. They were not the sort of
boys who loaf about stores and pool halls, listening
to cheap talk. Far from that. They
had come to make a purchase or two and, in
an hour, with the steel-blue stars above them
would be on their way home. Just now the
fire felt good.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure, tell us,&rdquo; Johnny encouraged.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_33">[33]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Hello! You here?&rdquo; Blackie demanded, as
if he had not seen them before. &ldquo;What&rsquo;d you
come in for on a night like this?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wedges,&rdquo; said Johnny. &ldquo;Steel wedges for
splitting logs.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wedges.&rdquo; There came a hoarse laugh
from the corner. It was Jack Mayhorn who
spoke. &ldquo;Who wants wedges in this country?
Do like I do. Cut down the trees that split
easy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;ve all got tough spots,&rdquo; Johnny replied
quietly. &ldquo;Where the limbs have been
cut off.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, the knotty pines!&rdquo; Jack laughed again.
&ldquo;Roll &rsquo;em into the fence row an&rsquo; leave &rsquo;em.
That&rsquo;s the way we do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We don&rsquo;t,&rdquo; said Lawrence. &ldquo;We aim to
take them as they come, tough or not tough,
they&rsquo;ve got to bust.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why?&rdquo; Blackie fixed his piercing black
eyes on the boy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&mdash;I don&rsquo;t know why,&rdquo; was Lawrence&rsquo;s
slow reply. &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t explain it right.&rdquo; The
boy hesitated. &ldquo;But I&mdash;you know&mdash;I sort of
hate being licked, even by a tough log. So I&mdash;we
sort of take &rsquo;em as they come.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_34">[34]</div>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s great!&rdquo; Blackie slapped his knee.
&ldquo;And I suppose you feel the same way?&rdquo; he
asked of Johnny.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure do,&rdquo; was Johnny&rsquo;s prompt reply.
&ldquo;They can&rsquo;t come too tough for me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t come too tough for little old Johnny.&rdquo;
There was a sneer in Jack Mayhorn&rsquo;s
voice. &ldquo;But he&rsquo;s afraid to set traps or carry
a rifle.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not afraid,&rdquo; Johnny replied quietly. &ldquo;Just
don&rsquo;t want to.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tell us, Blackie,&rdquo; Joe, the store-keeper,
broke in, sensing a possible row, &ldquo;tell us how
you got that leg.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Even then Blackie did not comply at once.
Turning to the boys, he said in a low tone,
&ldquo;You boys are dead right. No use letting a
log or anything else lick you.&rdquo; Dropping his
voice still lower he added, &ldquo;I might take you
with me next spring on that coast guard boat.
I just might, that is, if you still want to go.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then in a changed voice he said, &ldquo;All right,
Joe, I&rsquo;ll tell you all about that leg of mine,
though I&rsquo;m not fond of doing it. It always
makes me hopping mad, just thinking about it.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_35">[35]</div>
<p>&ldquo;You see,&rdquo; he went on at once, &ldquo;I was up
a river in Asia. Doesn&rsquo;t matter which river.
I was in the navy. Less than six months ago,
although it seems two years. I was on a small
U. S. gunboat. What one? That doesn&rsquo;t matter,
either. She&rsquo;s at the bottom of the river
now.&rdquo; He paused to stare at the fire.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We were laying up the river. There was
fighting down below. We&rsquo;d come up-river to
get out of the way. The fighting was foolish
enough, but none of our business.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We were there to protect American citizens.
There were twenty or more of them on
board, reporters and missionaries and the like.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d just come on duty when a big bombing
plane came hovering, like a vulture, over us.
It circled off again. &lsquo;Good riddance,&rsquo; I said to
my buddy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hadn&rsquo;t finished saying it when it came
zooming back. This time higher up and&mdash;&rdquo;
Blackie took a long breath. &ldquo;The bloomin&rsquo; infidels!
What do you think? They let go a bomb
that missed us by inches.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You should have seen us scatter,&rdquo; Blackie
laughed in spite of himself.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_36">[36]</div>
<p>And then, of a sudden, the lines between his
eyes grew deep and long. &ldquo;They bombed us.
They sank our ship. My buddy was killed. I
caught it in the leg. I got a lifeboat off, doing
what I could to save the women.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Me,&rdquo; he faltered. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m no sort of a story
teller. But I hope I&rsquo;m something of a fighter.
This old leg will be good as new next spring.
And, sure&rsquo;s I&rsquo;m living, I&rsquo;m going hunting little
brown men up there in Bristol Bay. They
stole a cool million dollars&rsquo; worth of fish last
season. How many&rsquo;ll they get this year? That
depends on the Coast Guard men and, glory
be! I&rsquo;m one of them. I&rsquo;m out of the navy,
invalided home, back on the good old job, and
there&rsquo;ll be plenty of things a-popping in May.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Er, excuse me, boys,&rdquo; he apologized. &ldquo;That
sounds an awful lot like bragging. We didn&rsquo;t
catch the Shadow that passes in the fog last
season. We didn&rsquo;t do those Orientals much
harm, either. Too slick for us, I guess. But
wish me luck next time. The biggest industry
in Alaska, the run of red salmon, depends on
us.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_37">[37]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Here&rsquo;s luck,&rdquo; said Johnny, lifting a cup of
coffee just poured by Joe&rsquo;s motherly wife.
&ldquo;Here&rsquo;s luck to the service.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And may you be my buddy!&rdquo; Blackie added.</p>
<p>That night Johnny and Lawrence walked
home in silence. The great white world was
all about them and the blue-white stars above.
Their thoughts were long, long thoughts.</p>
<p>Arrived at their log cabin home, they
dragged out a tattered map of Alaska to study
its shore-line and most of all the shores of
Bristol Bay.</p>
<p>&ldquo;May,&rdquo; Lawrence said at last. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s a
long time yet.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; Johnny agreed, &ldquo;and there&rsquo;s plenty
to get excited about tomorrow. What do you
say we turn in?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_38">[38]</div>
<h2 id="c3"><span class="small">CHAPTER III</span>
<br />FAT AND FURIOUS</h2>
<p>Anyone who had watched the two boys
skating slowly up the river next morning
would surely have been puzzled. Before
them, now darting up a steep bank and now
scurrying along over the snow, were two
brown, fur-clad creatures. Neither dogs nor
cats, they still appeared quite domestic in their
actions. Once when they had gone racing
ahead too far Johnny let out a shrill whistle
and they came dashing back to peer up into
his face as if to say, &ldquo;Did you call me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;re great!&rdquo; Lawrence chuckled. &ldquo;Got
a dog beat a mile. They never bark.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And yet they can find where wild creatures
live,&rdquo; Johnny agreed.</p>
<p>Just now, as you no doubt have guessed,
the boys were looking for the spot, under
some great rock or at the foot of a tree, which
the silver fox called his home.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_39">[39]</div>
<p>&ldquo;We must find him,&rdquo; Johnny had exclaimed
only an hour before.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We surely must,&rdquo; Lawrence had agreed.</p>
<p>And indeed they must, for three principal
reasons. Last night the fox had, by shrewd
cunning, managed to pry the chicken coop
door open and made off with a rooster. The
fox was worth a lot of money&mdash;they were
sure of this&mdash;dead or alive. They must get
him before someone with a gun or with traps
got sight of him. And they must take him
alive, if possible&mdash;a very large contract.</p>
<p>Their desires had been redoubled by something
that had happened only the night before.
Mack Gleason, the settler whose claim joined
them on the west, had been in for a friendly
chat.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Got your tractor yet?&rdquo; he had asked of Mr.
Lawson.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not yet,&rdquo; had been the reply.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, you better hurry. They&rsquo;re going fast.
May not be another shipment until it is too
late for spring&rsquo;s work.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No money just now.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_40">[40]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Money!&rdquo; Mack exploded. &ldquo;Who said anything
about money? Government gives &rsquo;em to
you on time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But time has a way of rolling around,&rdquo; Mr.
Lawson had replied quietly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, the Government wouldn&rsquo;t be hard on
you,&rdquo; Mack laughed. &ldquo;Look at us. We&rsquo;ve got
a washing machine and a buzz-saw, and a motor
to run &rsquo;em, a tractor, plow, harrow, everything,
and all on time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I know,&rdquo; had come in the same slow,
quiet tones. &ldquo;And I know the Government
won&rsquo;t be hard on you. Still it will want its
money, same as any loaning agency. It just
has to be that way.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This week,&rdquo; Mr. Lawson went on after a
moment, &ldquo;I received a letter from an old friend
of mine. Few years back he secured a government
loan on his home. He didn&rsquo;t keep up the
interest and payments. They took it from him.
Now he&rsquo;s unhappy about it. But people who
borrow must pay. That&rsquo;s why we&rsquo;re trying
not to borrow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And we won&rsquo;t, not if we can help it.&rdquo; Lawrence
set his will hard as he now followed
those dark brown creatures over the ice.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_41">[41]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Johnny,&rdquo; he said suddenly. &ldquo;Do you think
father should let us use traps?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&mdash;I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; Johnny replied slowly.
&ldquo;But that, for us, is not the question. Ours is,
&lsquo;Have we a right to urge him to let us use
them?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And the answer is, &lsquo;No,&rsquo;&rdquo; he chuckled. &ldquo;So
we&rsquo;ll have to trust our little old otters to lead
the way. When they find Mr. Silver Fox for
us we&rsquo;ll have to grab him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If only one of those trapping fellows
doesn&rsquo;t get him first,&rdquo; Lawrence said, wrinkling
his brow.</p>
<p>Early in the season, as, with dreamy eyes,
the boys wandered over the forty acres of land
that was, they hoped, to be their home for
years to come, they had caught the low, whining
notes of some small creatures apparently
in distress.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It comes from under that rock,&rdquo; Johnny
had said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, over here beneath this dead tree
trunk,&rdquo; Lawrence insisted.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_42">[42]</div>
<p>He was right. Having torn away the decayed
stump, they had found two round,
brown balls of fur. These balls were baby
otters. Taking them home, they had raised
them on a bottle. And now, here they were,
paying their debt by scouting about in search
of the silver fox.</p>
<p>Pets they were, the grandest in all the world.
The happiest moments of their young lives
were these long hikes. Never once did it seem
to occur to them that it might be nice to desert
their young masters and answer the call
of the wild.</p>
<p>Now, as the boys followed them, they went
gliding here and there peeking into every crack
and crevice of ice or frozen shore. From time
to time they poked their noses into some hole
into which strange tracks had vanished. After
a good sniff they put their heads together and
uttered low whining noises. These noises varied
with their opinions on the condition of
each particular hole. At times they appeared
to shake their heads and whine, &ldquo;Too bad. He
was here three hours ago. Now he&rsquo;s gone.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At other times they put their noses in the
air and sang triumphantly, &ldquo;He&rsquo;s there. He&rsquo;s
right in that hole this minute.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_43">[43]</div>
<p>Had the boys been able to train their pets
to go in the hole and frighten out the prey,
they might have held a moose-hide sack at the
entrance to each hole and added quite rapidly
to their collection of living Arctic animals.
This, however, the otters would not do. They
were not looking for a fight. And indeed, why
should they? They did not live upon squirrels
and muskrats, but upon fish. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll find &rsquo;em,
you catch &rsquo;em,&rdquo; seemed to be their motto.</p>
<p>For the boys, finding the lair of the silver
fox would not insure his capture. It merely
meant that they would know where he lived
and would watch that spot in the hope that
he might come out on the ice in search of food
or a drink and that then they might come
speeding in to grab him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look!&rdquo; Lawrence exclaimed suddenly,
&ldquo;there are Old Silver&rsquo;s tracks!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, sir! He just cut in from the hill to
the river. He&mdash;&rdquo; Suddenly Johnny broke off
to peer upstream.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Something moving up there,&rdquo; he whispered.
&ldquo;Maybe&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_44">[44]</div>
<p>But the otters had smelled the fox tracks
and were off on swift tracking feet. Johnny
bent over to examine those tracks.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s the old fellow or his brother,&rdquo; he murmured.
&ldquo;No other fox around here has such
large feet. Boy! He&rsquo;s a humdinger!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Once more his keen eyes swept the upper
reaches of the river. &ldquo;Huh!&rdquo; he grunted.
&ldquo;Whatever that was, it&rsquo;s vanished now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Might as well follow the otters,&rdquo; Lawrence
suggested.</p>
<p>They did follow. Soft-footed in silence they
tracked on for a mile. Up banks and down
again, over a ridge, back to the river. &ldquo;Look
at those feathers!&rdquo; Lawrence whispered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Got a ptarmigan,&rdquo; said Johnny. &ldquo;After that
he should have made a bee line for his lair.&rdquo;</p>
<p>That was just what the fox had done.
Straight as an arrow he had returned to the
stream, then he had sped away along its course
until he came to a huge gray rock. There the
trail ended. And beneath this rock, according
to the verdict of the two singing otters, he
must still lie fast asleep.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good old otters!&rdquo; Lawrence exclaimed in a
hoarse whisper.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_45">[45]</div>
<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;ve found us his hiding place,&rdquo; Johnny
agreed. &ldquo;And will we watch it? We&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Suddenly he broke off short to point excitedly
upstream.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A bear cub!&rdquo; Lawrence exclaimed low.
&ldquo;He&rsquo;s going to cross the river.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&mdash;we&rsquo;ll get on our sk-ates,&rdquo; said Johnny
excitedly. &ldquo;Then let&rsquo;s take him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can we?&rdquo; Lawrence was doubtful.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure! We&rsquo;ll lasso him and tie him up.
He&rsquo;ll make a grand addition to our zoo. Come
on!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Swinging out on the shining ice, skating
silently from the hips, the boys glided like
two dark ghosts toward the unsuspecting bear
cub who, at that moment, had started to cross
a broad stretch of slippery ice. Sly silence is,
however, a game that two can play at. This
the boys were to learn very soon and to their
sorrow.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_46">[46]</div>
<p>One day the boys had come, quite unexpectedly,
upon a half-grown white caribou, or perhaps
it had been a reindeer, that had wandered
down from some far northern herd. However
that might have been, they were filled with
regret at the thought that they were not
equipped for capturing it for their &ldquo;zoo.&rdquo;
From that time on they had carried lariats
and, by way of some added safety, short, stout
spears. They were thus equipped today as
they sped swiftly, silently toward the bear cub.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll toss the lasso over his head, then you
watch the fun,&rdquo; Johnny chuckled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll watch all right,&rdquo; Lawrence agreed. And
he did.</p>
<p>Slowly, clumsily, the young bear, no larger
than a good-sized dog, made his way across
the ice. The wind was away from him. He
could not smell the intruders, nor was he
aware of their presence until, with a sudden
rush, Johnny was upon him.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_47">[47]</div>
<p>Never will the boy forget the look of surprise
that came over the young bear&rsquo;s comical
face as he stared straight into his eyes. The
whole affair was easy, too easy. He passed
so close to the cub that he might have touched
him. He did not. Instead, he dropped his noose
over his head, pulled it tight, then, letting out
slack, whirled about to face the cub. What
would the cub do about that? He was to know
instantly. Throwing himself back on his
haunches, the cub began backing and pulling
like a balky horse. On his skates, Johnny was
no match for him. All he could do was to come
along. To his further annoyance, he found
that his lariat had whirled about his wrist
and tied itself into a knot. As long as the cub
kept the line tight he could not untie the knot.
He did not quite relish the idea of dashing up
to the cub and saying, &ldquo;By your leave, I&rsquo;ll untie
this knot.&rdquo; So, for the moment, he played
into the cub&rsquo;s hand.</p>
<p>Then the unexpected happened. With a
grunt and a snarl of rage, a huge black bear,
the cub&rsquo;s mother beyond a possible doubt,
dashed over a ridge to come charging straight
at Johnny and the cub.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hey! Hey! Look out!&rdquo; Lawrence shouted.
&ldquo;Drop your rope and beat it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&mdash;I can&rsquo;t,&rdquo; Johnny cried in sudden consternation.
&ldquo;He&mdash;he&rsquo;s got me tied.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tied!&rdquo; Lawrence gasped.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_48">[48]</div>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s &rsquo;round my wrist.&rdquo; Johnny watched
wide-eyed while the huge mother bear came
tobogganing down the high, steep river bank.
She hit the ice like a bobsled and, dropping
on hind legs and tail, came sliding straight on.</p>
<p>Just in time, Johnny came to his senses and
began doing a back-stroke. Only by inches did
he miss the husky swing of the angry bear&rsquo;s
paw.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Cut the rope,&rdquo; Lawrence shouted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Al-all right, I&rsquo;ll&mdash;I&rsquo;ll cut it.&rdquo; Johnny dug
into a pocket with his free hand. A pocket
knife. It must be opened. With one eye on the
cub, who for the moment sat whining, and the
other upon the mother bear, who was scrambling
awkwardly to her feet, he had no eyes
left for his knife. Just as, having gripped the
handle with one hand, the blade with the other,
he managed to open the knife, the cub, going
into frenzied action, gave him a sudden jerk
that sent the knife spinning far out on the ice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s gone,&rdquo; he groaned.</p>
<p>No more time for this. Old mother bear was
after him. Fortunately this old bear was
heavy with fat. She had been preparing for a
winter&rsquo;s sleep. Still she could travel and she
was fat and furious. Her skill as a skater was
something to marvel at.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_49">[49]</div>
<p>Since he could not escape from the rope, the
only thing for Johnny to do was circle. Circle
he did. One time around with the bear at his
heels; two times around he had gained a little;
three times around he caught the gleam of his
knife. Could he stoop and pick it up? He bent
over, made a reach for it, struck a crack with
his skate and all but fell.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&mdash;I&rsquo;ll get it next time,&rdquo; he breathed.</p>
<p>To his surprise he found that next time the
knife was well out of his reach. Then to his
utter horror, he saw that the perverse cub was
standing still, making an animated Maypole
out of himself and that it would be no time at
all until the rope would be all wound around
him. They would meet face to face, cub, mother
bear and boy. And after that? He shuddered
as he sped along that ever-narrowing
circle.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m coming in,&rdquo; Lawrence shouted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, you&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Johnny could say no more. Lawrence was
already in. Skating straight at the bear to
attract her attention, Lawrence shot past her
and slapped her sharply on the nose.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_50">[50]</div>
<p>It was a daring and effective endeavor.
Turning with a snarl, completely abandoning
her cub at this fancied insult, the bear went
after him with a rush.</p>
<p>That was all right as far as it went. The
skating was good. The bear was fast, but not
fast enough to catch him. There is, however,
an end to all things. There was an end to that
stretch of ice. It ended in a series of rapids
that were not frozen over.</p>
<p>Lawrence groaned as he saw open water
ahead. To his added terror, he saw that the
river narrowed at that point. That the bear
could outrun him on land he knew all too
well.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Got to be an artful dodger,&rdquo; he told himself.</p>
<p>At that moment how he rejoiced that he had
trained himself as a hockey skater. Swinging
about in a half circle, he sped toward the right-hand
bank. But the bear was there ahead of
him.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_51">[51]</div>
<p>Just as she reared up for a sledge-hammer
blow, the boy whirled squarely about and shot
away to left. Again he was too late for a safe
passage, but not so much too late. He was
gaining. Three more times, then with a joyous
intake of breath he shot past the bear and
was away.</p>
<p>In the meantime, Johnny, safe for the moment
from the mother bear, had hastily unwound
the surprised cub, then had rushed him
with such speed that the rope was off his neck
before he could lift a paw. The cub was free.
So was Johnny. And there were no regrets.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Johnny,&rdquo; said Lawrence as he joined his
companion five minutes later, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think
we want any bears in our zoo. They&rsquo;re too
playful.&rdquo; They were to change their minds
about this, but that was to come sometime
later.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That,&rdquo; said Johnny with a chuckle, &ldquo;was
almost funny.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; Lawrence agreed, &ldquo;almost.&rdquo; He did
not laugh. &ldquo;Almost, but not quite.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A moment later he exclaimed, &ldquo;Johnny!
Where are the otters? We can&rsquo;t lose them.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_52">[52]</div>
<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;ll probably hunt us up. They&mdash;&rdquo;
Johnny broke off short. &ldquo;Look!&rdquo; he murmured
low. &ldquo;Look! There&rsquo;s the silver fox.
He&rsquo;s out of his hole. He&mdash;he&rsquo;s going to cross
the ice.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lawrence glanced back to the spot where
the bears had been. They had vanished. &ldquo;This
time,&rdquo; he whispered, &ldquo;we&rsquo;ll get that old silver
fox. We simply must.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_53">[53]</div>
<h2 id="c4"><span class="small">CHAPTER IV</span>
<br />THE CAPTURE OF OLD SILVER</h2>
<p>Johnny felt his pulse quicken as he sped
along over the ice. The silver fox had
come out of the hole. There could be no doubt
of that. Would he dodge back in again or
would he start across the ice?</p>
<p>&ldquo;If he starts!&rdquo; the boy breathed.</p>
<p>He must not be too fast nor too sure. Last
time he had muffed a glorious chance. Slowing
up, he slid in behind a clump of elders and
came to a standstill. There, gripping a shrub,
he stood trembling like a butterfly ready for
flight.</p>
<p>As for Lawrence, he was coming on more
slowly. Naturally more cautious than his cousin,
he had an eye out for trouble. That fat
old mother bear might still be lurking among
the ridges. He had not forgotten how she had
come charging down upon them.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_54">[54]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t take unnecessary chances,&rdquo; he told
himself. &ldquo;Life is wonderful. I am sure that
taking unnecessary chances is wrong. It is
making light of God&rsquo;s great gift to us&mdash;life.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ah, yes, it was good to live just now. For
the first time in their lives his little family felt
sure of having a home of their own. As he
glided slowly along he thought of the summer&rsquo;s
struggle. At first it had been damp and
bitterly cold. Then the sun had been hot and
the mosquitoes had come in swarms.</p>
<p>Through all this they had labored on; father,
mother, and these two stout boys. It was said
that gangs of men would be along to clear
patches of land and build cabins. To this they
had not listened. &ldquo;We came to make our own
way,&rdquo; they insisted. &ldquo;We are pioneers. Pioneers
must work.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When garden and potato patches were
planted they had started the cabin. Selecting,
from near and far, trees that were dead
but not decayed, they had built a cabin whose
walls would not warp and shrink as would
those built of green timber.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_55">[55]</div>
<p>Later, in the autumn when sharp winds told
of a long winter ahead, they had cut squares
of tough sod and piled them about the cabin
until it seemed a sod house. When the question
of a heating stove had arisen, they had
discovered an abandoned gasoline barrel, had
cut one hole for a door, another for the stove-pipe,
had done a little drilling and riveting,
and thus had made a stove that, fed on crackling
fir logs, laughed at the Arctic cold.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pioneers!&rdquo; he whispered. &ldquo;We are pioneers.&rdquo;
How he loved that thought.</p>
<p>Of a sudden his attention was drawn from
past to present by Johnny&rsquo;s beckoning hand.
With a quick twisting glide, he moved silently
forward until he was at his companion&rsquo;s
side.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look,&rdquo; Johnny gripped his arm. &ldquo;There is
the fox. He hasn&rsquo;t started across yet and&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And there are the otters!&rdquo; Lawrence broke
in with a shrill whisper.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; Johnny agreed. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s the queer
part of it. They came just so close to the fox,
then seemed to shout something at him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Like one boy daring another to come out
and fight,&rdquo; Lawrence laughed low.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_56">[56]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, or inviting him to a game of tag,&rdquo;
whispered Johnny. &ldquo;And look! There he goes!
There goes the fox! Good old otters! They
are helping&mdash;helping a lot.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He had spoken the truth, the fox was after
one of the otters.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Little good it will do him,&rdquo; Lawrence
chuckled. &ldquo;Those otters are more at home on
ice and in water than on land.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Listen!&rdquo; Johnny&rsquo;s voice was tense now.
His figure stiffened. &ldquo;In a minute I&rsquo;m going
after him. I&rsquo;ve got the bag. If I get him I&rsquo;ll
pop him inside. I won&rsquo;t miss now. You just
follow along slowly. I might need you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Al-all right,&rdquo; the younger boy agreed.</p>
<p>There might have been boys who would
have said, &ldquo;This is my turn. You muffed last
time.&rdquo; Not so Lawrence. All too well he knew
the skill and natural daring of his cousin. And,
after all, in their little family the rule had ever
been, &ldquo;Each for all and all for each.&rdquo; So he
watched his cousin glide silently out for one
more adventure.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_57">[57]</div>
<p>Ten seconds later in watching the little
drama of wild life being played there on the
ice, he had all but forgotten Johnny. Never
before had he seen the tame otters put on such
a clever show. Just as the larger one had so
far escaped the onrush of the fox that he was
becoming discouraged, the small otter, with
cunning and extreme daring, slipped up and
all but shouted in the fox&rsquo;s ear. At once, the
now thoroughly angered fox turned to dash
after this second intruder.</p>
<p>No sooner had the first otter been abandoned
than he turned about to begin slipping
up on the fox to dare him for one more race.</p>
<p>&ldquo;For all the world like a game of tag!&rdquo;
Lawrence murmured.</p>
<p>All this was aiding Johnny, though it is to
be doubted whether the otters knew the value
of their antics. The fox was being led farther
and farther out on the ice. At the same time
his attention was so held by this strange game
that he was almost certain to miss catching
sight of the boy who now glided closer, ever
closer to him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good old otters!&rdquo; Johnny repeated in a
whisper as, drawing his moose-hide mittens
tight, he prepared for the final dash.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_58">[58]</div>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s going after him,&rdquo; Lawrence thought
as, with a thrill shooting up his spine, he
glided from his sheltered spot, ready, if need
be, to come in on the finish.</p>
<p>With a suddenness that must have been
startling to the keenest eyes, Johnny swept
down upon the fox and the otters. Did the otters
see him? Beyond doubt. They saw everything.
But the fox? For once he was caught
quite unawares. One startled look, a quick
squatting down on the ground, and Johnny
was at his side. Before the fox could relax
from this stiff pose, Johnny&rsquo;s hands, like a
brass collar, were about his neck.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You got him!&rdquo; Lawrence shouted, springing
into action. &ldquo;You got him! Hurray!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then a terrible thing happened. Overjoyed
at their great good fortune, Lawrence for the
moment lost his bearing. Of a sudden his
skate struck ice that crunched ominously. He
tripped to go plunging forward into the black
waters of the racing river. He had fallen into
an open pool.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_59">[59]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll drown,&rdquo; he thought, as, in an involuntary
manner, he struck out with his hands in a
swimming motion. All too late he saw ice
ahead. Next instant he was beneath the river&rsquo;s
ice.</p>
<p>Johnny saw all this. With a gasp of terror
he all but dropped the fox. Then, scarcely
knowing what he did, he thrust the fox as if he
were his mother&rsquo;s fur scarf, into the moose-hide
bag, drew the strings tight, then shot
away toward the spot from which his cousin
had vanished.</p>
<p>As Lawrence shot beneath the ice, life
seemed near its end. Yet there had never been
a time when life had seemed so real and so
joyous as now. For a second panic gripped
him. Holding his breath, he tried to think.</p>
<p>In an instant his mind was clear. He knew
what he should do. There were two open
pools farther on. How far? He did not know
exactly. Could he hold his breath till then?
He must hope. And he must try to move over
closer to the shelving bank. If he reached the
pool he might then touch bottom.</p>
<p>Desperately he struggled to draw himself
over to the left. His head hummed. His lungs
were bursting, his heart pounding.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_60">[60]</div>
<p>&ldquo;It&mdash;it&rsquo;s the end,&rdquo; he thought.</p>
<p>And then, up he popped. Just in time, as
his feet touched, he gripped the edge of the
ice and held there. Ten agonizing seconds he
clung there, then a voice shouted, &ldquo;Hold on,
I&rsquo;m coming.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ten seconds more and Johnny, who had
leaped to the bank and raced along it, reached
out to grip his mackinaw.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now!&rdquo; he shouted. &ldquo;Out you come.&rdquo; And
out he came.</p>
<p>Weak from excitement and exhaustion, he
lay there for a time motionless.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This won&rsquo;t do,&rdquo; Johnny exclaimed at last.
&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve got to get going. Here,&rdquo; he dragged
the sodden mackinaw from his cousin&rsquo;s shoulders,
then put his own sheep-lined coat in its
place. After putting his own dry mittens on
Lawrence&rsquo;s hands, he pulled him to his feet.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s you for skates and the ice, then home
as fast as ever you can.&rdquo; He pushed him on
before him.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_61">[61]</div>
<p>As his skates touched the ice Lawrence felt
new warm blood racing through his veins. He
was off with the speed of the wind. And after
him, with a moose-hide sack dangling at his
side and filled with one very angry silver fox,
came his loyal, anxious yet joyous friend and
cousin, Johnny.</p>
<p>The day, for this part of the world, was not
extremely cold. Lawrence&rsquo;s trousers froze into
pipe-like forms, but his sturdy, youthful body
resisted the cold and sent him speeding on his
way.</p>
<p>Dropping down on the river bank at last,
they dragged off their skates to take the usual
short cut through the timber.</p>
<p>As he passed the carefully built shelter beside
that narrow stream, Johnny recalled the
note tacked to a post and wondered afresh
whether the mysterious Bill would arrive, just
as the note said he would, on July 1st.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who do you suppose he left that note for?&rdquo;
he exclaimed suddenly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Haven&rsquo;t&mdash;the&mdash;slightest-notion,&rdquo; Lawrence
panted, still racing along. &ldquo;One&mdash;thing&mdash;is&mdash;sure.
I&rsquo;m&mdash;going&mdash;to&mdash;be&mdash;there&mdash;when
that day comes.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_62">[62]</div>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll both be there,&rdquo; Johnny agreed. Somehow,
as he thought of it, in a strange way it
seemed that Bill and the silver fox must in
some way be associated with each other. &ldquo;Pure
moonbeams,&rdquo; he assured himself, yet the
thought remained in the back of his mind.</p>
<p>There is something in the north that is
called &ldquo;Grapevine telegraph.&rdquo; This name is
given to the mysterious means by which, in a
land devoid of telephone and telegraph, news
travels fast and far. Was it this unreal telegraph
that, six hours later, as Lawrence, none
the worse for his experience, lay before the
roaring fire, brought a stranger to their door?
Who can say? Be that as it may, there he was.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Excuse me for intruding,&rdquo; said the tall,
smiling stranger as he brushed the snow from
his moccasins. &ldquo;I heard you&rsquo;d got a silver fox
and I just had to have a look at him. It&rsquo;s been
three years since I saw one. I&rsquo;m Jim Clem.
Got a claim over on the other side of the settlement.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&mdash;you&rsquo;ve seen silver foxes.&rdquo; Johnny
was on his feet.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hundreds of &rsquo;em.&rdquo; The stranger smiled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hun-hundreds,&rdquo; Johnny stammered. &ldquo;I
thought they were rare.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_63">[63]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Used to be,&rdquo; admitted Jim Clem. &ldquo;Still
are, fairly so. Did you get a good one?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I&mdash;well,&rdquo; Johnny whirled about. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll
show you.&rdquo; Opening the back door, he dragged
in a small wire cage. &ldquo;We just put him in this
for a little while,&rdquo; he half apologized.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! He&rsquo;s alive. Hurt much?&rdquo; Jim asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not hurt at all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not hurt?&rdquo; Jim stared. &ldquo;How&rsquo;d you catch
him?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;With my hands,&rdquo; Johnny chuckled. Then,
seeing that this would not stand as a bare
statement, he explained briefly their method of
capture.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Say-ee,&rdquo; Jim exclaimed, dropping into a
chair, &ldquo;you&rsquo;re regular natives. And that&rsquo;s a
fine specimen. Time was when you&rsquo;d get two
thousand dollars for him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, we&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But not now,&rdquo; Jim broke in. &ldquo;Never again.
Know much about foxes?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, we&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_64">[64]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Then, I&rsquo;ll tell you.&rdquo; Jim settled back in his
chair. &ldquo;I worked on a silver fox farm for
three years. &lsquo;Million Dollar Farm,&rsquo; they called
it. And that&rsquo;s what it was. Raised only silver
foxes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But you don&rsquo;t get that way all at once,&rdquo; he
laughed. &ldquo;Not by a great deal. Take that
fellow you got there. Suppose you find him a
mate and decide to start raising silver foxes.
Pretty soon you&rsquo;d have a lovely lot of cute
little fox cubs. But would they be silver foxes?
Not one. That&rsquo;s almost certain.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not one?&rdquo; Lawrence sat up.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s it,&rdquo; Jim agreed. &ldquo;You&rsquo;d get two or
three little red foxes and, with great luck, a
cross fox, that&rsquo;s all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You see,&rdquo; he leaned forward, &ldquo;a silver fox
is a freak, just as a half-white robin is. If a
half-white robin hatches his eggs his young
ones are likely to be jolly little robin redbreasts,
nothing more.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Only by keeping foxes for years and years
can you at last hope to raise pure silver foxes.
That takes thousands and thousands of dollars.
Four brothers went in for that in a big
way years ago. Last year they sold 13,000 pelts
for more than $1,000,000. And that,&rdquo; he added,
&ldquo;figures up to something like $77.00 apiece.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_65">[65]</div>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s what our fox is worth,&rdquo; Lawrence
groaned. &ldquo;And we&rsquo;d have to kill him to get
that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, sure,&rdquo; Jim grinned. &ldquo;But truly,&rdquo; his
face sobered, &ldquo;that&rsquo;s the tough part about fox
farming. In the end you&rsquo;ve got to kill &rsquo;em, so
some fine lady can drape their skins about her
neck.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d never sell ours to a fox farm,&rdquo; Lawrence
said with conviction.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How about selling him alive to some zoo?&rdquo;
Johnny asked hopefully.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t know very much about that,&rdquo; Jim
replied slowly. &ldquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t hope too much.
There are 5,000 fox farms these days. And
they raise some beauties.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But if you mean to keep this fellow alive,&rdquo;
he added, &ldquo;you want to get a wooden barrel
and make it into a den for him. Pack it all
&rsquo;round with chaff and moss to make it warm.
Then build him a wire pen all about it. He&rsquo;ll
get along fine if you do that.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_66">[66]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll have to trot along.&rdquo; He rose to go.
&ldquo;Come and see me. I&rsquo;ll tell you more about
&rsquo;em. They&rsquo;re interesting no end, foxes are.&rdquo;
He bade them goodnight.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; Johnny drawled slowly, &ldquo;Old Silver
won&rsquo;t buy us a tractor, that&rsquo;s sure.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Lawrence. &ldquo;But we can learn a
lot about him and we can at least keep him
from eating our chickens. Don&rsquo;t give up the
ship. We&rsquo;ll happen onto something yet.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There are other rewards than money in this
life of ours. Remarkable achievement of any
sort usually brings us kind words of deserved
praise from our fellowmen. It was so with
Johnny and Lawrence. More than one settler
had suffered from the night raids of Old Silver.
Now that he was in prison his captors
were highly praised.</p>
<p>Still the problem remained; should they give
up their dream of complete independence and
go in debt for a tractor?</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think you&rsquo;d better,&rdquo; said Johnny. &ldquo;There
are only a few left and they are going fast.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;ll always be the Titan,&rdquo; Lawrence
laughed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, the Titan,&rdquo; Johnny agreed. &ldquo;But who
could ever pay for that tractor?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_67">[67]</div>
<p>The Titan was a powerful new type of tractor.
Only one had been brought on and that
one was priced at a cool thousand dollars.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll wait a little longer,&rdquo; was Mr. Lawson&rsquo;s
decision. &ldquo;The tide of fortune may turn
our way.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_68">[68]</div>
<h2 id="c5"><span class="small">CHAPTER V</span>
<br />JOHNNY FIGHTS FOR FUN</h2>
<p>News travels fast in the north. When
the time came for the boys to make one
more journey to the store at Palmer everyone
had heard of their catch.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here they come,&rdquo; someone shouted as,
stamping the snow from their feet, they entered
the smoke-filled room.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here they come. They bring &rsquo;em back
alive!&rdquo; someone else shouted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; Lawrence drawled, &ldquo;we bring them
anyway. Got two minks today. That&rsquo;s two
more that won&rsquo;t carry off folks&rsquo; chickens.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hear you boys got a silver fox.&rdquo; There
was a suggestion of antagonism in Jack Mayhorn&rsquo;s
voice as he said this.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; Johnny replied. &ldquo;And we&rsquo;ve still got
him.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_69">[69]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Do you know, fellows,&rdquo; Jack gave vent to
a chuckle that seemed a little strained, &ldquo;back
in Michigan, where I lived on the shores of
Lake Superior, there was a feller who used
to go lake-trout fishin&rsquo;. He trolled with an
out-board motor. Always got &rsquo;em, too, a
whale of a fine catch.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But you know,&rdquo; he edged forward in his
chair, &ldquo;there was net fishermen there, too.
Fished fer a living. And one day when we
was lookin&rsquo; over this sportin&rsquo; fellow&rsquo;s catch,
the fish he claimed he&rsquo;d caught trollin&rsquo; we
found had net marks on &rsquo;em.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Net marks?&rdquo; someone said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure.&rdquo; There was a shifty look in Jack&rsquo;s
eyes. &ldquo;He&rsquo;d been liftin&rsquo; nets an&rsquo; helping himself
to the fish that didn&rsquo;t belong to him. And
I was wonderin&rsquo;,&rdquo; he paused, &ldquo;just wonderin&rsquo;,
Johnny, if that silver fox of yours mebby had
a lame foot or&mdash;or somethin&rsquo;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The silence that followed was painful.
Johnny made no reply. His fingers worked
along his palm, that was all.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_70">[70]</div>
<p>It was Blackie Dawson who spoke at last.
&ldquo;I take it, Jack,&rdquo; he spoke slowly, &ldquo;you are
insinuating that these boys took the fox from
your trap. Let me tell you, old man, that sort
of thing calls for a fight; in the north it does.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jack made no reply, but Johnny did.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry,&rdquo; he said, speaking slowly. &ldquo;It
doesn&rsquo;t mean a fight to me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You won&rsquo;t fight?&rdquo; Blackie stared at him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not to settle a personal grudge,&rdquo; Johnny
replied slowly. &ldquo;If Jack wants to think we
took the fox from his trap, that&rsquo;s his privilege.
If he would like to examine the fox that&rsquo;s his
privilege also. But I&rsquo;m not going to beat him
up just to make him take back something he&rsquo;s
said. That might seem to be a point of honor
but we all have our own codes of honor. It
may seem queer but I&rsquo;d rather take an insult
than give someone a beating.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Take a beating you mean,&rdquo; Jack sneered.
He was nearly twice Johnny&rsquo;s size.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Joe,&rdquo; said Johnny, turning to the store-keeper,
&ldquo;you told me you got two pairs of boxing
gloves through the mail.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure, Johnny, I did. Here they are.&rdquo;
Reaching behind him the store-keeper drew
out two pairs of gloves.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Put &rsquo;em on, Johnny,&rdquo; Blackie encouraged.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_71">[71]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Put &rsquo;em on! Put &rsquo;em on!&rdquo; came from all
over the room. There was a stir of expectancy
in the air.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure, I&rsquo;ll put them on,&rdquo; Johnny grinned.
&ldquo;What do you say, Joe? I&rsquo;ll box you five
rounds. Five friendly bouts for fun, money or
marbles.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The crowd stared, Johnny was talking not
to the man who had offered the insult but to
his friend the store-keeper.</p>
<p>For a moment Joe stood staring at him.
Then, as the light of a smile spread over his
face, he said, &ldquo;Sure, Johnny, I&rsquo;ll box you, not
for money or marbles, but just, you might say,
for fun.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It will be a long time before the settlers of
Matanuska Valley will again witness such a
match as followed. Five rounds for fun, between
friends? Yes, perhaps. And yet there
were times when even Johnny doubted that.
True, he was not angry for a moment, just in
there doing his best. But Joe? He was wondering
about him.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_72">[72]</div>
<p>Though he had told no one in the valley
about it, Joe had, only the year before, belonged
to the U. S. Marines. The Marines
neither give nor ask quarters. And Joe had
been champion of his regiment. As for Johnny,
well you know Johnny. If you don&rsquo;t, you
should have been there that night.</p>
<p>From the start it was leather against leather,
a slap for the chin, a thrust at the heart,
a bang on the side of the head, and after that
a clinch.</p>
<p>Seldom had men been more evenly matched.
Joe was older, more experienced, Johnny
younger, faster on his feet.</p>
<p>They had not been going a minute when an
involuntary ring had formed about them. In
that ring, gaping open-mouthed was Jack
Mayhorn.</p>
<p>Twice Johnny was down on a knee. Each
time he was up and at it. Once, backed into a
corner, Joe tripped and fell. He, too, was up
before the count of three.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_73">[73]</div>
<p>The fifth round was wild. Had there been
an announcer, he must surely have lost his
mind calling, &ldquo;A right to Johnny&rsquo;s chin, a left
to his ear. The ear is bleeding. Oh&mdash;a! A
slam on the side of Joe&rsquo;s head that makes him
slightly groggy. Johnny&rsquo;s following through.
The clinch! The referee (Blackie) separates
them. They are sparring now. Now! Oh,
now! Johnny takes one on the chin. He&rsquo;s
down. One&mdash;two&mdash;three&mdash;He&rsquo;s up again.&rdquo;
So it went to the end.</p>
<p>As the cowbell, rung by young Larry Hooker,
announced the close of the round, the
crowd went wild with enthusiasm, but Joe,
seizing Johnny by the glove, dragged him into
the kitchen at the back of the store.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Boy, you&rsquo;re a whiz!&rdquo; he exclaimed. &ldquo;There
was a time or two when I thought you had
me.&rdquo; He was mopping Johnny&rsquo;s face with a
wet towel.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not a chance,&rdquo; Johnny laughed. &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t
know what I was stepping into but I did my
best.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Listen,&rdquo; Joe held up a hand. The tumult
in the outer room had died down. Blackie
Dawson was about to make a short speech.
&ldquo;Gentlemen,&rdquo; he was saying, &ldquo;the day after
tomorrow at early candle light, there&rsquo;ll be another
boxing bout in this room. It will be between&mdash;&rdquo;
he paused&mdash;&ldquo;between Jack Mayhorn
and&mdash;he&mdash;he has a choice&mdash;Johnny Thompson
or Joe Lawrence.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_74">[74]</div>
<p>&ldquo;No!&rdquo; a voice fairly roared after the shouts
had subsided, &ldquo;I got a bad foot. My footwork,
it ain&rsquo;t no good at all.&rdquo; It was Jack
Mayhorn who spoke.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So it&rsquo;s <i>your</i> foot that&rsquo;s bad and not that
silver fox&rsquo;s foot?&rdquo; Blackie bantered.</p>
<p>The crowd let out a roar that could have
been heard a mile.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;ll about fix Jack Mayhorn,&rdquo; said Joe.
&ldquo;He&rsquo;s not likely to bother you much now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>An hour later, when the customers had
&ldquo;cleared out and gone home,&rdquo; Johnny and
Lawrence found themselves in Joe&rsquo;s kitchen.
Blackie and Joe were there. So was Mrs. Joe.
They were all eating huckleberry pie and
drinking hot chocolate.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Johnny,&rdquo; said Joe, feeling a plaster on his
chin, &ldquo;why did you do it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do what?&rdquo; Johnny stared.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pick on me for a fight. I never done you no
wrong.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s why,&rdquo; was Johnny&rsquo;s astonishing reply.
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s an old Eskimo custom.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_75">[75]</div>
<p>&ldquo;What is?&rdquo; They all stared at him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;According to the Eskimo law,&rdquo; Johnny
went on soberly, &ldquo;if you are going to be killed
it has to be done by a near relative or very
close friend. So-o&mdash;&rdquo; he added with a spreading
grin, &ldquo;I thought you&rsquo;d do as well as anyone.
And you did&mdash;even better.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Anyway,&rdquo; Blackie supplemented after
their laugh was over, &ldquo;folks in Matanuska Valley
will know who among us can put up a
good scrap and that always helps.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When one is young he thinks only of the
present and the future, never of the past. As
the two boys walked home that night, they
thought much of the future. The bond of
friendship between them and Blackie Dawson
was growing stronger every day. When spring
came, would they go booming away with him
on a Coast Guard boat in search of adventure
in Bristol Bay? Who could tell?</p>
<p>In the meantime there was work to be done,
plenty of it. Some twenty acres of land was
yet to be cleared. In the spring stumps must
be pulled. Without a tractor this would mean
back-breaking labor.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_76">[76]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps we can get more foxes?&rdquo; Lawrence
said, thinking out loud.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, and other wild creatures,&rdquo; Johnny
added. &ldquo;That country &lsquo;back of the beyond&rsquo; has
never even been explored. There must be wild
life back there that&rsquo;s never been seen. Peary
found white reindeer on one of his expeditions.
Who can tell what we&rsquo;ll come upon if
we keep up our search?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Who, indeed? The boy had spoken more
wisely than he knew.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_77">[77]</div>
<h2 id="c6"><span class="small">CHAPTER VI</span>
<br />SMOKEY JOE&rsquo;S BLUE BEARS</h2>
<p>Johnny awoke with a start. What had
wakened him? He could not say for sure.
He had a feeling that it had been a human
voice, perhaps a shout.</p>
<p>Propping himself up on one elbow he listened
intently. There came no sound save the
long-drawn distant howl of a wolf. &ldquo;Must
have dreamed it,&rdquo; he murmured as he drew
deep into the caribou-skin bed.</p>
<p>The night was cold, bitter cold. It was
dark. Like chilled white diamonds, stars glistened
in the sky. &ldquo;What a change a few hours
can make,&rdquo; he thought. They were sleeping in
the mysterious Bill&rsquo;s shelter, he and Lawrence.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_78">[78]</div>
<p>Why were they sleeping in this cheerless
shelter? Warm beds awaited them at home.
When one is young he does not need too good
an answer for the thing he does. Both Johnny
and Lawrence were born scouts. They loved
the sharp tang of cold on their cheeks, followed
by the quick glow of a campfire. The
smell of wood-smoke, deer steak broiled over
coals, dreamy hours just sitting before the fire,
not talking, just thinking, all these were a joy
to them. So they liked to get away for a night.
Bill&rsquo;s camp was a convenient place.</p>
<p>Johnny did not fall asleep at once, instead
his mind was crowded with dreamy thoughts.</p>
<p>Perhaps Bill was a gold prospector. Perhaps
he had discovered gold. Then when he
returned to this camp, they might all go tramping
away to find the spot and stake out claims.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That would ruin the settlement,&rdquo; he told
himself. &ldquo;People would desert their dreams
of making homes for brighter, more illusive
dreams of wealth. And yet&mdash;&rdquo; What did he
wish? He could not tell.</p>
<p>When they had retired for the night the
moon had been shining, a bright fire gleamed
before their shelter. Now all was gloomy and
cold. Should he rekindle the fire? &ldquo;No. Too
chilly,&rdquo; he shuddered. &ldquo;Wait till morning.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_79">[79]</div>
<p>The days that had gone before had been uneventful
ones. More and more he had come
to realize that they must have a tractor. Long
hours they had worked clearing timber. Brush
was burned. But wood must be saved for fires,
for buildings and fences. Every day saw
larger piles of wood on the cleared land.</p>
<p>&ldquo;With a tractor and a stout sled we&rsquo;d have
it hauled home in no time,&rdquo; Lawrence had
said to his father. &ldquo;Without it&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wait a little longer,&rdquo; his father had counseled.</p>
<p>So they were waiting and tonight, sleeping
in Bill&rsquo;s shelter, they were still waiting.</p>
<p>So Johnny thought and dreamed until at
last he fell asleep.</p>
<p>Perhaps he slept an hour, perhaps less or
more. Then he awoke with a suddenness that
set his senses reeling.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Law-Lawrence!&rdquo; he shouted in wild consternation.
&ldquo;The bear! The bear!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Something solid and heavy as a bear had
landed with all but crushing weight on his
chest. It still rested there but did not move.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_80">[80]</div>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s no bear,&rdquo; said a gruff, good-natured
voice. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s my pack. Sorry! Didn&rsquo;t know
you was here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lawrence!&rdquo; Johnny exclaimed. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s Bill!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not Bill neither,&rdquo; the stranger disagreed.
&ldquo;They call me Smokey Joe.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Smokey Joe!&rdquo; Johnny peered into the darkness,
trying to get a look at the man&rsquo;s face.
&ldquo;Smokey Joe. I&rsquo;ve heard of you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And he surely had. Smokey was a well-known
character in the valley. The old-timers
told how he came and went. Always in search
of gold, he would disappear for months.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then,&rdquo; one of the motherly women added,
&ldquo;just when we think he&rsquo;s gone for good, up
he pops again. We feed him up and patch his
clothes. Then, like some boy, he&rsquo;s off again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But he&rsquo;s no boy,&rdquo; she added. &ldquo;He came to
Alaska in the gold rush of &rsquo;97.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Eighteen-ninety-seven!&rdquo; Johnny had exclaimed.
&ldquo;More than forty years ago!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He never left,&rdquo; the gray-haired lady had
added. &ldquo;He came from the Cumberland Mountains
somewhere and he still speaks in their
queer way.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_81">[81]</div>
<p>&ldquo;They say,&rdquo; she added with a lowered voice,
&ldquo;that he struck it rich once, had nearly half
a million dollars, and that he&rsquo;s got some of it
hid away in the hills somewhere. But, then,&rdquo;
she sighed, &ldquo;you can&rsquo;t believe anything you
hear and only half you see in Alaska. Alaska
is a place of wild dreams.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Johnny was recalling all this as he made
haste to split dry wood into fine pieces, whittle
some shavings, then light a blaze in their
out-of-doors fireplace.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s about morning,&rdquo; he said, at last looking
into Smokey Joe&rsquo;s seamed face. &ldquo;Did you
come far?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Been travelin&rsquo; mighty nigh all night,&rdquo; the
old man drawled. &ldquo;Me and my hounds here.&rdquo;
He nodded at three powerful dogs, already
curled up on the snow for a sleep. &ldquo;Right
smart cold up yonder. Hit&rsquo;s a sight better here
in the bottoms.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll have coffee before you know it,&rdquo;
Johnny said cheerily. &ldquo;Coffee and sour-dough
flap-jacks.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah,&rdquo; the old man sucked in his breath.
&ldquo;Sour dough flap-jacks. They shore do stick
to yer ribs. Reckon Smokey Joe&rsquo;s the flapjack
eatinest feller you almost ever seed.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_82">[82]</div>
<p>Lawrence grinned. This old man spoke a
strange language.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A bear!&rdquo; Smokey chuckled. &ldquo;You all
thought I were a bear! That&rsquo;s right smart
quare.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We almost caught a cub,&rdquo; Johnny explained.
&ldquo;Caught him alive, I mean.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Almost.&rdquo; Lawrence laughed. &ldquo;But his
mother objected.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bears,&rdquo; said the old man, blinking at the
fire. &ldquo;Back thar in them thar glaciers thar&rsquo;s
bears you might nigh wouldn&rsquo;t believe the
plain truth about.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why?&rdquo; Johnny sat up. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s strange
about them?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Might nigh everythin&rsquo;s quare, I reckon.
Hm,&rdquo; the old man sniffed the coffee, &ldquo;smells
powerful good.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;ll be boiled in a minute or two,&rdquo; said
Johnny. &ldquo;But tell me about those bears.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_83">[83]</div>
<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;re blue, plumb blue, like a thin sky.&rdquo;
The old man struggled for words. &ldquo;They&rsquo;re
right smart woolly like sheep, I reckon. But
they ain&rsquo;t sheep. God-a-mighty, narry a bit
of it. One of them clawed my lead dog like
tarnation. An&rsquo; they&rsquo;re the fish-eatinest critters
you most ever seed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Polar bears?&rdquo; Johnny suggested.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Polar bears, big as good-sized hounds!&rdquo;
Smokey sniffed. &ldquo;Who&rsquo;s ever hearn tell of
sech polar bears?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Who indeed? Johnny was growing excited
and confused. &ldquo;Woolly, blue bears no bigger
than dogs,&rdquo; he was thinking. &ldquo;What kind of
bears could they be?&rdquo;</p>
<p>In his confusion he upset the coffeepot and
spilled half its contents. For all this, there
was plenty left. Smokey Joe drank it piping
hot, ate in a ravenous manner. Then, springing
to his feet and calling to his dogs, declared
he must get down to Palmer for a new pack of
grub.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s found a trace of color in some dashing
stream that doesn&rsquo;t freeze, not even in winter,&rdquo;
was Johnny&rsquo;s conclusion. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s going to
hotfoot it right back and get rich&mdash;maybe.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But, Johnny,&rdquo; Lawrence was not smiling,
&ldquo;do you really suppose there are any such
bears as he described?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_84">[84]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Of course not,&rdquo; was Johnny&rsquo;s prompt reply.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But, Johnny, if there were, if we caught
one alive! No bigger than a dog. We could
do it, Johnny. We could buy a tractor.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Forget it. It&rsquo;s all a pipe dream, I tell you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But Lawrence did not forget Smokey Joe&rsquo;s
blue bears, nor, in the end, did Johnny.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_85">[85]</div>
<h2 id="c7"><span class="small">CHAPTER VII</span>
<br />A STRANGE BATTLE</h2>
<p>Shortly after noon of that same day a
slim, bright-eyed man in a huge beaver
overcoat drove up to the Lawson cabin. Johnny
and Lawrence, who were about to go back
to their wood cutting, stared at him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hello, boys,&rdquo; was his surprising greeting.
&ldquo;I hear you bring &rsquo;em back alive.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, yes, we&mdash;Sometimes we do,&rdquo; Johnny
replied in confusion.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Blackie Dawson told me about you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Blackie.&rdquo; Johnny&rsquo;s face brightened.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am in the animal business,&rdquo; the man explained,
alighting from his hired sled and allowing
Lawrence to lead his horse away. &ldquo;I
thought you boys might help me a little.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Help you? Oh, sure!&rdquo; Things were looking
better and better. &ldquo;Here&rsquo;s where we get a
start,&rdquo; Johnny was thinking.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_86">[86]</div>
<p>&ldquo;What have you?&rdquo; the man asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, er&mdash;mister&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They call me Professor Ormsby,&rdquo; said the
stranger. &ldquo;You may call me what you please.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, then, Professor,&rdquo; Johnny went on,
&ldquo;we have a silver fox, a perfectly keen fox.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Caught in a trap, I suppose?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No. By hand.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;By hand!&rdquo; The Professor stared. &ldquo;How
do you do it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Johnny told him in as few words as possible
and with no dramatics at all, just how it was
done.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I say!&rdquo; the Professor exclaimed.
&ldquo;That&rsquo;s great! You took a chance with that
fox. But, let me see&mdash;No-o, I can&rsquo;t use a
silver fox. How about beavers?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We haven&rsquo;t taken any beaver. We&mdash;well,
we were afraid it might be against the law
even to catch them alive.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have a government permit,&rdquo; said the Professor.
&ldquo;But if you haven&rsquo;t any beaver&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Catching beaver would be easy. We have
a grand colony not three miles away,&rdquo; Lawrence
put in. &ldquo;We might&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_87">[87]</div>
<p>&ldquo;How about mink?&rdquo; Johnny asked. &ldquo;We
have some fine ones. Or snow-shoe rabbits?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I suggest that you eat the rabbits,&rdquo; the Professor
laughed. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll have a look at your mink.
But beaver! There&rsquo;s your main chance. Can&rsquo;t
you get me some? Big ones, the bigger the
better.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You see,&rdquo; he smiled, &ldquo;we think we&rsquo;re really
doing good through this work. In the big cities,
hot in summer and cold in winter and
crowded always, there are hundreds of thousands
of children who would never know what
a woodchuck, a monkey, a beaver or a bear
looked like if they didn&rsquo;t see them in a zoo.
Brings real joy to them, I&rsquo;m sure. Many&rsquo;s the
fellow who dates his first real interest in the
wide out-of-doors to his visit at the zoo.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I&mdash;&rdquo; Johnny had scarcely heard him.
&ldquo;Could we do it?&rdquo; he was asking himself. He
was thinking of beaver. &ldquo;Why not? Thousands
and thousands of city children.&rdquo; His
head was in a whirl.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think,&rdquo; he tried to make his voice seem
very cheerful, &ldquo;I think we can supply the beaver.
Can&rsquo;t we, Lawrence?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_88">[88]</div>
<p>&ldquo;What? Yes. Oh, yes,&rdquo; Lawrence replied.</p>
<p>&ldquo;One of them must be a big one, a real boss
of the village,&rdquo; warned the Professor.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve got him,&rdquo; Johnny laughed uncertainly.
&ldquo;Napoleon himself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes. Oh, yes. We&rsquo;ve got him, all right,&rdquo;
Lawrence did not laugh.</p>
<p>Strangely enough, as a short time later the
boys went away on one more &ldquo;Bring &rsquo;em back
alive hunt&rdquo; there was no spring in their step.
Their faces were sober. If they succeeded this
one more time, the coveted tractor would be
within their grasp, and yet they appeared anything
but happy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Might even get the Titan,&rdquo; Lawrence tried
to tell himself. This boy loved fine machinery
and that Titan tractor was a beauty. It had
power, plenty of it. With it they could not
only pull stumps and plow fields for themselves,
but do work for other settlers on shares
and, in quiet times, they could work on the
road. &ldquo;Four live beavers,&rdquo; he thought. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s
all it takes.&rdquo; Yes, that was all it took, and
yet&mdash;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_89">[89]</div>
<p>Up a small stream that flows into the Matanuska
River early in the year the boys had discovered
a beaver colony. Many an hour they
had spent watching these busy beavers. Never
in all their lives had they seen such feats of
engineering done by creatures of the wild.</p>
<p>There were at least sixty beavers in the
group. One big fellow, weighing sixty pounds
or more, was the leader. He was the boss contractor.
And such a boss as he was!</p>
<p>&ldquo;Napoleon,&rdquo; they had named him. He stood
for hours, as the great little general is pictured,
straight, stiff and soldier-like. To him came
the others. Were there trees to be felled?
Two lieutenants came marching soberly up to
him. They talked earnestly, nodding their
heads, like real people, then off they rushed
to start a dozen beavers doing the work.</p>
<p>It was so in everything. Most interesting of
all had been the building of the big dam. This
work, the boys understood, must be rushed.
Winter would come. Ice would freeze two feet
thick. The level of the stream must be raised
to six feet so the beaver tribe could use the
water beneath as a highway all winter long.
The water must be dammed up.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_90">[90]</div>
<p>This dam building, done under the wise direction
of old Napoleon, had progressed rapidly
for a time, then a sudden freshet of water
loosened some of the beams and the whole affair
threatened to go down stream.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;ll they do now?&rdquo; Lawrence had
asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wait and see,&rdquo; was Johnny&rsquo;s answer.</p>
<p>Old Napoleon sent his men, like sub-engineers,
all over the dam, making a study of
conditions. Then, apparently abandoning all
this work, he ordered a new dam built a hundred
feet farther down stream.</p>
<p>But did he truly abandon his first work?
Not a bit of it. He and his crew built just
enough of a dam below to raise the water and
relieve the pressure from the original dam.
Then, with an air of professional pride, Napoleon
returned to his old post and the work
was well completed before frost.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He,&rdquo; Johnny thought to himself, &ldquo;is the
friend we mean to capture and sell into slavery,
Old Napoleon.&rdquo; Little wonder that his
heart was heavy. &ldquo;Old Napoleon,&rdquo; he whispered
once again.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_91">[91]</div>
<p>But what was this? As they neared the beaver
colony where they were sure to find Napoleon
out sunning himself, they caught sight
of some creature skulking through the brush.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a wolf,&rdquo; Johnny whispered. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s follow
him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Follow him they did, and to their consternation
saw that he was headed for the beaver
colony.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;d better frighten him away,&rdquo; Lawrence
whispered. &ldquo;He&rsquo;ll drive all the beavers beneath
the ice. Then we won&rsquo;t be able to lasso
a single one.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This, Johnny knew, was good advice, but
for some reason scarcely known to himself, he
said, &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s wait.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When at last they caught sight of the beaver
village, they saw old Napoleon standing stiff
and straight as ever in his place. He was having
a sun bath.</p>
<p>After sneaking along through the brush, the
wolf made a dash at the beaver.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;ll kill him,&rdquo; Lawrence whispered.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_92">[92]</div>
<p>Did he? Strange to say, as the wolf came
near, the beaver did not stir from his place.
This appeared to surprise the wolf, who did
not at once rush in for the kill. Sneaking up
close, he made a dash at the beaver, but
stopped just short of his goal. Still the beaver
did not move. To the boys this seemed strange.
Their respect for the old fellow grew by leaps
and bounds. He appeared to be saying,
&ldquo;What&rsquo;s a wolf that one should fear him?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&mdash;he&rsquo;s great!&rdquo; Johnny shrilled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Magnificent,&rdquo; Lawrence agreed.</p>
<p>Snarling low, the wolf began dashing and
snapping at the beaver. Each snap made him
bolder. Now his ugly jaws were three feet
from the apparently defenseless hero of wild
life, who had decided to give his life for his
home and his people. Now he was only two
feet away. And now only a foot.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&mdash;we&rsquo;d better step in,&rdquo; came from Lawrence.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wait,&rdquo; Johnny gripped his arm hard. Perhaps
he should stop the wolf, but he waited,
fascinated.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now!&rdquo; Lawrence caught his breath. The
end, he was sure, had come.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_93">[93]</div>
<p>And then, of a sudden, things did happen,
but not in accord with expectations. Old Napoleon
had chisel-shaped teeth that cut wood
like a hatchet. Without a sound, as the wolf,
having grown bold, snapped in his very face,
he shot forward to close those murderous teeth
over the wolf&rsquo;s closed jaws.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Great Scott!&rdquo; Johnny muttered.</p>
<p>The struggle that followed was fast and furious.
Kicking and scratching, the wolf rolled
over and over, but not once did Napoleon&rsquo;s
locked grip loosen. It was only when his opponent,
completely exhausted and all but
smothered, lay limp at his side, that he at last
pried his own jaws apart to climb awkwardly
to his place in the sun. Instantly the wolf
dragged himself to his feet, to go slinking
away into the brush.</p>
<p>For one full minute the boys stood there
motionless. When Lawrence spoke his voice
was husky. &ldquo;Johnny, I&rsquo;ve often suspected old
Napoleon of being a tyrant. He&rsquo;s lazy, too.
I&rsquo;ve never seen him do a lick of work. But he
is one swell engineer and a grand boss.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s more, he&rsquo;s no coward,&rdquo; Johnny
added.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_94">[94]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Johnny, I can&rsquo;t do it,&rdquo; Lawrence dangled
his lasso.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Neither can I,&rdquo; said Johnny. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s go.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Turning, they made their way in silence
down the narrow stream to its mouth. There
they dropped down upon the snow to put on
their skates.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Johnny,&rdquo; said Lawrence, &ldquo;we&rsquo;re a pair of
old softies.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right,&rdquo; said Johnny. &ldquo;But I don&rsquo;t
mind, do you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not a bit. Let&rsquo;s go.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="tb">&ldquo;Get &rsquo;em?&rdquo; the Professor asked as they
came stamping into the cabin.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No&mdash;er, well, no we didn&rsquo;t,&rdquo; Johnny stammered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How come?&rdquo; the man&rsquo;s face sobered. &ldquo;That
was your big moment.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sensing the tenseness of the situation, Mrs.
Lawson said, &ldquo;The coffee&rsquo;s hot. I have some
spice cookies, just out of the oven. How would
you like a bite to eat?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&mdash;that would be splendid!&rdquo; said the
Professor.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_95">[95]</div>
<p>When, over their cups of coffee, the boys
had told the whole story, there was a strange
look on the Professor&rsquo;s face as he said, &ldquo;Can&rsquo;t
say that I blame you. Under the circumstances
I should have done the same thing.
We shall be obliged to get our beaver some
other way. And as for your tractor&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&mdash;we&rsquo;ll manage,&rdquo; Lawrence replied
slowly. Then, &ldquo;By the way, Professor. You
must know about bears. Are there any light
blue bears?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Blue bears? Let me think! Oh, certainly!
They belong up this way, too. Very rare they
are, though.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Blue bears!&rdquo; Lawrence became greatly excited.
&ldquo;Small blue bears, no larger than a
good-sized dog, with woolly hair? They&mdash;they
live on fish?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What?&rdquo; It was the Professor&rsquo;s turn to become
excited. &ldquo;You haven&rsquo;t seen one? You&mdash;you
couldn&rsquo;t catch one for me, could you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure&mdash;sure,&rdquo; Lawrence stammered. &ldquo;No,
I mean we haven&rsquo;t. That is, we could, I&mdash;I&rsquo;m
sure we could.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_96">[96]</div>
<p>&ldquo;If you were to bring me one of those bears
alive and in good condition,&rdquo; the Professor
spoke in a deeply solemn voice, &ldquo;you might
name your own price. Glacier bears, they are
called. There is a stuffed specimen in the United
States National Museum, but not a single
living specimen in captivity anywhere.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&mdash;we&rsquo;ll hunt up Smokey Joe tomorrow,&rdquo;
Johnny said. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s seen them. He can tell us
where they are. In fact, he told us all about
them, only I thought it was all hooey.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Smokey Joe? Who is that?&rdquo; the Professor
asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;An old prospector,&rdquo; Johnny explained.
&ldquo;He&rsquo;s been all over this country.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In that case,&rdquo; said the Professor, &ldquo;much as
I should like a glacier bear, I suggest that you
postpone your search until late spring. Those
rare creatures inhabit the wildest sort of country,
rocks, cliffs and glaciers. They are worse
than mountain goats. You would almost certainly
perish. And besides, it is fairly certain
that they, like most others of their kind, hibernate.
And so&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So another bubble bursts,&rdquo; Johnny
groaned.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_97">[97]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be too pessimistic,&rdquo; the Professor
smiled. &ldquo;I shall hope to hear from you sometime
in June or early July. A single specimen
will do.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And, by the way,&rdquo; he added as he rose,
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve decided to offer you a hundred dollars
for your silver fox. That may not seem such
a good price, but is really above the market.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sold! Sold!&rdquo; the boys exclaimed in unison.
And so it was that the boys collected
their first real money. They were, however,
still a long way from their goal.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_98">[98]</div>
<h2 id="c8"><span class="small">CHAPTER VIII</span>
<br />THE STORMY PETREL&rsquo;S FIRST PRIZE</h2>
<p>As the winter wore on the cold grew more
intense. Ice on the streams was thick.
Wild animals appeared to vanish from the
scene. Snow covered much of the river surfaces.
All these things served to make &ldquo;bringing
them home alive&rdquo; more difficult.</p>
<p>At last the boys gave up this strange occupation
and turned to the task of clearing the
ten-acre tract.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If we can get that tract cleared we&rsquo;ll plant
it in barley, oats and peas. When these are
ground together they make excellent chicken
feed. We&rsquo;ll go in for poultry. There&rsquo;s a steady
market for dressed chickens and eggs at Fairbanks,&rdquo;
said Mr. Lawson.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, if we get that tract cleared,&rdquo; Lawrence
thought, but did not say. No further
suggestion that they go into debt for a tractor
was made by anyone.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_99">[99]</div>
<p>The long Arctic evenings were divided between
games and dreaming. The fame of Johnny&rsquo;s
and Joe&rsquo;s boxing had traveled far. The
recreation room at Palmer was given over to
this excellent sport two nights a week.</p>
<p>A boxing club was formed. Even Jack Mayhorn
dropped his feud with Johnny and joined
up. Members of a boxing club at Seward accepted
an invitation for a contest. Johnny and
Joe won this by a narrow margin.</p>
<p>On the evenings when business or pleasure
did not take them to town Johnny and Lawrence
might often be found dreaming by their
own hearth-fire.</p>
<p>&ldquo;When the land is cleared and plowed, when
the grain is sowed and we&rsquo;ve earned a breathing
spell,&rdquo; Lawrence would say, &ldquo;then we&rsquo;ll
hunt up old Smokey Joe and go out for one of
those glacier bears.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If we can find Smokey Joe,&rdquo; Johnny would
smilingly agree. &ldquo;And if they don&rsquo;t need us
for service in Bristol Bay.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bristol Bay,&rdquo; Lawrence would reply doubtfully.
&ldquo;Seems as if I&rsquo;d rather catch animals
alive than go after those Orientals.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_100">[100]</div>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll take them alive, too,&rdquo; Johnny chuckled.</p>
<p>Lawrence was not so sure of this. Hour
after hour Blackie Dawson, who had discarded
his crutches, entertained them with stories
of his adventures with the Orientals.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They want everything for themselves.
They spoiled their own fishing by catching
the salmon before they were half grown and
canning them right on the ships. Now they
want to come over here and do the same, right
up there in Bristol Bay.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They catch our fish and can &rsquo;em, then they
pop into Seattle or San Francisco and say,
&lsquo;See all the fine fish we have canned for you.
Come and buy them.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Think we&rsquo;ll do that?&rdquo; he would storm.
&ldquo;Not on your life! We&rsquo;ll get &rsquo;em. You&rsquo;ll see.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But the Shadow,&rdquo; his voice would drop,
&ldquo;that shadow that passes in the fog. How&rsquo;s
a fellow to catch that? Who can tell? But
we&rsquo;ll get it, too,&rdquo; he would add, striking the
table a lusty blow.</p>
<p>In March he received his appointment as
Commander of the <i>Stormy Petrel</i>.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_101">[101]</div>
<p>&ldquo;A swell boat.&rdquo; He was proud of her.
&ldquo;Come on down with me and we&rsquo;ll turn her
motors over once or twice just to get the rust
out of &rsquo;em.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Johnny and Lawrence accepted his invitation.
They did far more than turn the motors
over. With Lawrence as engineer and Johnny
as first mate, they cruised for three days along
the Alaskan shores.</p>
<p>On the third day, &ldquo;Just to get in practice,&rdquo;
as Blackie put it, they hailed a suspicious-looking
craft carrying no flag. When the
skipper failed to heed Blackie&rsquo;s command to
head around, they sent a ball from their shiny
brass cannon over her bow and she promptly
hove to.</p>
<p>She was found to be carrying contraband
drugs. &ldquo;A fair capture in a fair chase,&rdquo; as
Blackie expressed it. &ldquo;A regular feather in
our cap.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Johnny, &ldquo;how did you like it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Those are glorious motors,&rdquo; Lawrence enthused.
&ldquo;How I&rsquo;d love to be their master.
But I hope&mdash;&rdquo; he hesitated. &ldquo;I rather hope we
go after the glacier bears. That&rsquo;s the surest
way to get a tractor. And a tractor&rsquo;s what
we need most.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_102">[102]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Time and fate will decide,&rdquo; Johnny said
soberly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Time and Blackie,&rdquo; Lawrence added with
a laugh.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And Smokey Joe,&rdquo; Johnny amended.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_103">[103]</div>
<h2 id="c9"><span class="small">CHAPTER IX</span>
<br />FATE LENDS A HAND</h2>
<p>Strangely enough it was Fate, in the
form of an automobile accident in far
away Seattle, that cast the final vote deciding
their choice between the <i>Stormy Petrel</i> in
Bristol Bay and a glacier bear hunt with
Smokey Joe.</p>
<p>Spring had come at last. Steadfastly refusing
to go in debt, the Dawsons, with Johnny&rsquo;s
help, were attempting to clear their land
without the help of a tractor.</p>
<p>At first it was fun. With blasting powder
and dynamite they blew the larger stumps
into shreds. The boom&mdash;boom&mdash;boom of
blasts might be heard for miles.</p>
<p>There remained thousands of smaller
stumps. To force these from the tough sod
and heavy black soil with pick, shovel and bar,
was back-breaking labor.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_104">[104]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Give me time,&rdquo; Johnny would groan when
morning came. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s a place in my back
somewhere that bends. I&rsquo;ll find it. Just give
me time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Joke as they might, they could not but feel
that progress was woefully slow and that seed-time
would find them all unprepared.</p>
<p>One bright day an automobile came bumping
over the uneven road to pause before their
field. Out from it popped an old friend.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Blackie!&rdquo; Johnny exclaimed. &ldquo;I thought
you&rsquo;d be in Bristol Bay by now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m on my way,&rdquo; Blackie puffed. &ldquo;And so
are you.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Lawson,&rdquo; he exclaimed, &ldquo;I must draft
your boys into my service.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What about these stumps,&rdquo; Mr. Lawson
straightened his stiff back.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;ll it cost to have &rsquo;em out with a
tractor?&rdquo; Blackie demanded.</p>
<p>Both Johnny and Lawrence looked at him
with gleaming eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why do you need my boys?&rdquo; the man
among the stumps demanded.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_105">[105]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Two of the men who were to accompany
me have been crippled,&rdquo; Blackie explained.
&ldquo;They were in an auto accident in Seattle. I
had a wire this morning. They were so badly
hurt they could not let me know sooner. And
tomorrow we were to sail. Already there has
been news of trouble in Bristol Bay.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I tell you, Mr. Lawson,&rdquo; Blackie was pleading
now. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s for Alaska and her greatest
enterprise I ask it. Yes, and for every humble
American who makes a simple meal from a
can of salmon. As I see it, it&rsquo;s your patriotic
duty to let them go.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then Blackie did a strange thing for him.
He quoted poetry&mdash;</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;&lsquo;Not once nor twice in our fair Island&rsquo;s story</p>
<p class="t0">Has the path of duty been the way to glory.&rsquo;</p>
</div>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Lawson!&rdquo; he exploded, &ldquo;let them go.
Here!&rdquo; he waved a roll of bills. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll pull your
stumps. I&rsquo;ll plow your land and sow your
seed. Let them go.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Who could have refused? Surely not a man
with Tom Lawson&rsquo;s patriotic soul. &ldquo;Al-all
right, boys,&rdquo; he said huskily. &ldquo;Go get your
clothes. And&mdash;and Blackie, I must trust you
to bring them safely home.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_106">[106]</div>
<p>&ldquo;No need to worry,&rdquo; Blackie reassured him.
&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll all be back to shoot fire-crackers with
you on the Fourth of July. And may your
fields be green by then.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Twenty-four hours later Johnny and Lawrence
found themselves standing on the narrow
deck of the <i>Stormy Petrel</i> watching a
familiar shore-line fade from their sight.</p>
<p>To Johnny this seemed just one more journey
into the great unknown. To Lawrence it
was something more, his first long trip away
from his own family. Strange emotions stirred
within him. Questions he could not answer
crowded through his mind. How long was this
journey to last? What strange, wild adventures
would he meet? What would be the outcome?
Would they be of some real service?</p>
<p>Through his thoughts ran Blackie&rsquo;s two
lines of verse,</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;&lsquo;Not once nor twice in our fair Island&rsquo;s story</p>
<p class="t0">Has the path of duty been the way to glory.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p>What did it mean? He had only a vague
notion.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_107">[107]</div>
<p>&ldquo;MacGregor,&rdquo; he said to the gray-haired engineer
who thrust his head up from the engine
room, &ldquo;what do these words mean?&rdquo; He repeated
the lines.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, noo, me lad,&rdquo; said the friendly old
Scotchman, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve never been too good at
poetry. But it seems to me it says if ye think
first of yer country and her needs, ye&rsquo;ll be
likely to get the things you want most fer
yerself; that is, I meant to say, in the end.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thanks.&rdquo; Once again the boy paced the
deck. Was this true? He wanted a tractor, a
humble, earth-digging, sod-plowing, stump-pulling
tractor. It was a strange thing for a
boy to want, he knew. Most boys would have
wished for an automobile, but he wanted a
tractor. Would he get it?</p>
<p>As they left Seward behind and headed west
to follow the Alaskan Peninsula until they
could cross over into Bristol Bay, it seemed
to him that they were heading directly away
from his heart&rsquo;s desire. The pay they were to
receive was small. It would help very little.
&ldquo;And yet,&rdquo; he thought with a firm resolve to
do his best in his strange new position, &ldquo;Sometimes
fate does seem to take a hand in making
things come out just right. Here&rsquo;s hoping.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_108">[108]</div>
<p>The <i>Stormy Petrel</i> was a sturdy boat with
powerful motors. She was small&mdash;little larger
than a good-sized speed boat. But how she
could go!</p>
<p>There was a small after-cabin with six
bunks ranged along the sides. Here George,
the colored cook, presided over a small stove
producing glorious things to eat. The coffee
was always hot. And indeed it was needed,
for, as a gray fog settled down upon them, the
air became bitter cold.</p>
<p>Johnny was to take watch for watch with
Blackie as steersman. Lawrence was to exchange
watches with MacGregor and preside
over the motors. Had this been a week&rsquo;s
cruise simply for pleasure, nothing could have
been more delightful. Johnny loved boats.
Lawrence listened to the steady roar of his
motors and was joyously happy.</p>
<p>And yet, there hung over them a sense of
approaching danger.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Say-ee!&rdquo; Johnny exclaimed on the third
day, after taking their position and studying
the chart. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re closer to Asia than we are
to Seattle.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_109">[109]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Aye, that we are, me lad,&rdquo; MacGregor
agreed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, and that&rsquo;s why it&rsquo;s so easy for these
Orientals to slip over here and trap our fish,&rdquo;
Blackie exploded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And that,&rdquo; he went on quietly, &ldquo;is why you
settlers in Matanuska Valley are given so
much financial aid. Your old Uncle Sam wants
you there. He&rsquo;s going to locate more and
more people along these Alaskan shores. You
watch and see! Why? To give them homes?
Not a bit of it. To have people here to watch
those Orientals, that&rsquo;s why.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Johnny with a laugh. &ldquo;Looks
like we&rsquo;d learn a lot of geography and current
history on this trip.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No doubt about that, me lad,&rdquo; MacGregor
agreed.</p>
<p>They had been on the water for five days
when, touching Johnny on the shoulder,
Blackie pointed at two spots of white against
the sky.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_110">[110]</div>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s snow on two mountain peaks,&rdquo; he
explained. &ldquo;The cannery we&rsquo;re heading for is
built on the banks of a small river close to
these mountains. We&rsquo;ll be there before dark.
And after that,&rdquo; he took a deep breath. &ldquo;After
that our real work begins.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A new world,&rdquo; Johnny murmured dreamily.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t know half of it,&rdquo; said Blackie.
And Blackie was right.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_111">[111]</div>
<h2 id="c10"><span class="small">CHAPTER X</span>
<br />A NEW WORLD</h2>
<p>Next morning Johnny and Blackie Dawson
sat on the deck of the <i>Stormy Petrel</i>.
A wild nor&rsquo;wester was whipping up the ocean
spray. Even on the river well back from the
narrow bay, little whitecaps came racing in.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No day for going out!&rdquo; Blackie grumbled.
&ldquo;Pile up on the rocks, that&rsquo;s what we&rsquo;d do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; Johnny agreed. Fact is, he at that
moment was not thinking of the sea, but of
the quiet Matanuska valley, of the snug home
he and his people had built there. He wondered
in a vague sort of way how far this,
his latest venture, would lead him from that
home. He was thinking not so much for himself
as for his cousin Lawrence.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_112">[112]</div>
<p>Strange as it might seem, the welcome
given them by the people of the cannery had
not come up to their expectations. Men had
stared at them, had mumbled something under
their breath, then gone about their work.</p>
<p>Work there was to be done, too. There was
a pleasant hum of expectancy about the place.
Every motor, machine and conveyor in the
place was being given the once-over. Power-boat
motors thundered as they went through
their testing. Johnny felt a desire to become
a part of it all. And yet&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fool sort of thing this rushing off after
adventure,&rdquo; he told himself. But, had love of
adventure alone brought them this far, hundreds
of miles from his quiet valley? Love of
home was one thing, love of one&rsquo;s country another.
You didn&rsquo;t&mdash;</p>
<p>His thoughts broke off short. There had
come the sound of a loud voice. The <i>Stormy
Petrel</i> was anchored on a narrow dock that
ran along the side of a long, low building, the
cannery. A window was open. The speaker
was near. Johnny caught every word. As he
listened his ears burned. But what could he
do? He was on his own boat. People who do
not mean to be heard too far must speak
softly.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_113">[113]</div>
<p>Perhaps the man meant to be heard. There
was more than a suggestion of anger and
threat in his voice as he said, &ldquo;Fine fix we&rsquo;re
in! Huh! Here we are part of the biggest industry
in Alaska. Fifteen million dollars a
year. The Orientals start cuttin&rsquo; in on us. We
call for help, for protection. And what do we
get? A lousy tub no bigger than a gill-net
boat. And how&rsquo;s she manned, I ask you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>A second voice rumbled words that could
not be understood.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s manned by a crippled young skipper,&rdquo;
the first speaker growled. &ldquo;An old Scotch
engineer and two kids. Protection! Bah!&rdquo;
There came a grunt of disgust. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll have to
take things into our own hands.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At that a door slammed and they heard no
more.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well?&rdquo; Blackie tried to scare up a grin. It
was not a huge success. &ldquo;Kids,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re not quite that,&rdquo; Johnny said quietly.
&ldquo;We <i>are</i> pinch hitters.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure you are,&rdquo; Blackie agreed. &ldquo;But I
wouldn&rsquo;t trade you for half the so-called men
in the regular service.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_114">[114]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Say, Johnny!&rdquo; His voice dropped. &ldquo;Know
who that was talking?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No-o.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was Red McGee. He is the union agent
that looks after the interests of these men
working in the canneries. They say he&rsquo;s a
good man and a fighter, but narrow. A&mdash;a
fighter. Hm&rsquo;m&mdash;&rdquo; Blackie seemed to play
with the words.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Johnny,&rdquo; his whisper sounded like an exploding
steam valve. &ldquo;You <i>like</i> to box, don&rsquo;t
you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing I like better,&rdquo; Johnny grinned.
&ldquo;Started when I was six and never stopped.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Red McGee&rsquo;s a boxer,&rdquo; Blackie said. &ldquo;Off
times like this I&rsquo;m told these men up here go
in for boxing bouts. Nothing savage, you understand,
just a few friendly rounds. And
Red&rsquo;s never been beaten by any of them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And I suppose you expect me to trim him,
at least to try it?&rdquo; Johnny&rsquo;s face was a study.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No-o, not just that, only a few friendly
rounds. I&rsquo;d like you to represent the <i>Stormy
Petrel</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_115">[115]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I think I get you,&rdquo; Johnny&rsquo;s lips moved in
a quiet smile. &ldquo;You want this crowd to know
that I&rsquo;m not a child.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Johnny,&rdquo; Blackie&rsquo;s tone was almost solemn,
&ldquo;it&rsquo;s important. Mighty important! If this
fishing mob gets started and if they find a ship
out there in Bristol Bay catching fish contrary
to law, there&rsquo;s going to be trouble. More trouble
than all our diplomats can clear up in a
year.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s no getting &rsquo;round it, this business
has been slighted. But this much stands out
like your nose&mdash;we&rsquo;ve got to do what we can.
And we can&rsquo;t do much if these Alaskans sneer
at us.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So-o, son,&rdquo; he drawled, &ldquo;if they give you
a chance tonight you step in. And if a chance
doesn&rsquo;t open up, I&rsquo;ll open one.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come on,&rdquo; he sprang to his feet. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s time
for chow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Passionately fond of boxing as Johnny surely
was, he found himself dreading the encounter
Blackie had proposed for that night. Why?
He could not have told.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_116">[116]</div>
<p>A strange audience awaited him in the long,
low-ceilinged room where, on working days
cases of salmon were stored for shipping.
Seated on empty packing boxes, the men
formed a hollow circle. This circle was to be
the ring for the evening&rsquo;s entertainment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;re all here,&rdquo; Blackie grinned. &ldquo;A
dozen nationalities: Italians, Finlanders,
Swedes, down-east Yankees, an Eskimo or
two and what have you.</p>
<p>&ldquo;One thing they&rsquo;ve got in common,&rdquo; his
voice rang true, &ldquo;they&rsquo;re all Alaskans at heart.
Hard fighters, straight shooters, they look you
square in the eye and treat you fair. But when
anyone tries any dirty, underhanded work,
you&rsquo;ll see sparks fly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; Johnny smiled. &ldquo;Whatever else
happens, there will be no crooked work tonight.
I don&rsquo;t fight that way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t I know it?&rdquo; Blackie agreed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, now, here we are,&rdquo; he chuckled a
moment later. &ldquo;Reserved seats. Box seats,
mind you. Who could ask for more?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_117">[117]</div>
<p>As Johnny sat, quite silent in his place,
watching one short three-round match after
another being fought in a good-natured rough-and-tumble
fashion between boatmen, cannery
workers, carpenters, engineer and blacksmith,
he became more and more conscious of
one fact&mdash;the crowd was holding back its enthusiasm.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s like the preliminary bouts in Madison
Square Gardens,&rdquo; he said to Blackie at last.
&ldquo;They seem to be waiting for the one big fight.
What&rsquo;s coming?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t you guess?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No-o, I&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s you and Red McGee. They&rsquo;re waiting
for that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What?&rdquo; Johnny half rose to his feet.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Keep your seat.&rdquo; Blackie pulled him down.
&ldquo;Ever hear of the grapevine telegraph?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, in&mdash;in a sort of way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s the mysterious manner in which news
travels up here. These fellows know about
you. The minute I gave them your name they
busted out, &lsquo;The kid that packs a wallop?&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And you&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I said, &lsquo;Sure! None other. But does Red
McGee know it?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They said, &lsquo;Guess he doesn&rsquo;t. He&rsquo;s been in
Seattle, just come up.&rsquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_118">[118]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Then I said, &lsquo;Mum&rsquo;s the word. We&rsquo;ll just
ask him to give Johnny a few pointers in boxing.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And they agreed?&rdquo; Johnny seemed ready
to bolt from the room.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure. Why not?&rdquo; Blackie grinned. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s
the grandest way to get in with all of &rsquo;em.
They like a good joke. So does Red McGee.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Even if it&rsquo;s on him?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Even if it&rsquo;s on him. Absolutely.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then he&rsquo;s a real sport,&rdquo; Johnny settled
back in his place. &ldquo;It will be a real joy to box
him a few rounds.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Okie doke,&rdquo; Blackie seemed relieved. &ldquo;But,
Johnny,&rdquo; he added, &ldquo;pull your punches. Murder
isn&rsquo;t legal in Alaska, not south of the Arctic
Circle.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I only hope Red McGee remembers that,&rdquo;
was Johnny&rsquo;s solemn reply.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_119">[119]</div>
<h2 id="c11"><span class="small">CHAPTER XI</span>
<br />THE FALL OF THE RED McGEE</h2>
<p>When by popular request, emphasized
by loud shouts, Red McGee was called
upon to put on the gloves, he stepped forward
smiling. Johnny slid to the very edge of his
box for a good look. This was the first time
he had seen the man. He was a little startled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So that&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;m going up against?&rdquo; he
murmured low.</p>
<p>Six feet of man, broad shoulders, a shock of
red hair that stood straight up, a square jaw
and glittering eyes, this was Red McGee.</p>
<p>And was he popular? The hoarse shouts of
approval that made the rough rafters ring as
he stepped out on the floor left no room for
doubt.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_120">[120]</div>
<p>Red was to box three rounds with a man
named Tomingo, a dark-faced foreigner who
piloted a gill-net boat. Johnny was thankful
for this brief reprieve before he too should step
into the ring.</p>
<p>That Red McGee was no mean boxer he
learned at once. He had a head on his shoulders
and a remarkable eye.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He seems to anticipate every move this Tomingo
makes,&rdquo; Johnny groaned in a whisper.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They have boxed together before,&rdquo; was
Blackie&rsquo;s answer. &ldquo;Perhaps many times. When
you play a game with a man many times, just
any game, you come to know his tricks. But
you, Johnny, he doesn&rsquo;t know you. It&rsquo;s an
advantage.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But, Johnny,&rdquo; he cautioned after a moment&rsquo;s
silence, &ldquo;don&rsquo;t let him get to you. Look
at those arms! If he hits you just once, a good
square one, you&rsquo;re sunk.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And, boy,&rdquo; his voice dropped, &ldquo;this is a
big spot. It&rsquo;s important, mighty important.
These fellows must respect us, have faith in
the <i>Stormy Petrel</i> and her crew. If they don&rsquo;t,
they&rsquo;ll go storming out there six hundred
strong, looking for trouble. And if they find
it! Oh, man! They might start a war.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_121">[121]</div>
<p>&ldquo;There!&rdquo; Johnny breathed. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s the
bell. That match is over. And Red McGee is
just nicely warmed up.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The tall, lanky boatman who acted as referee
shuffled off the floor.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who&rsquo;s next?&rdquo; Red McGee invited with a
broad smile.</p>
<p>It was evident at once that few of the men
cared to take him on. Tomingo was wearing
a flaming patch where Red&rsquo;s glove had raked
his chin.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Red,&rdquo; one of his own men volunteered,
&ldquo;there&rsquo;s one of them kids from the <i>Stormy
Petrel</i> who&rsquo;d like to learn a little about boxing.
Would y&rsquo; mind a teachin&rsquo; him?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;One of those boys?&rdquo; Red looked squarely
at Johnny. Johnny flinched. Did Red know?
&ldquo;Oh, sure!&rdquo; Red&rsquo;s lips spread in a broad smile.
&ldquo;I like boys, always have. Sure I&rsquo;ll show him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look, Tom,&rdquo; he turned to the referee.
&ldquo;Help the boy on with his gloves. Be sure he
gets &rsquo;em on the right hands. It&rsquo;s awkward
boxing if you don&rsquo;t.&rdquo; He let out a low chuckle.</p>
<p>Once again Johnny flinched. What did Red
know? Probably nothing. This was just his
way of poking fun at the <i>Stormy Petrel&rsquo;s</i> crew.
This made Johnny a little angry, but not too
much.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_122">[122]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Show &rsquo;em, Johnny,&rdquo; Blackie hissed in his
ear. Next Johnny found himself shaking the
great paw of Red McGee. And so the fight
began.</p>
<p>Nothing had been said about the number of
rounds, nor their length. Johnny was a little
taken back when the referee settled himself
on a box in a corner.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But then,&rdquo; it came to him with a sudden
shock, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m supposed to be a learner. When
you&rsquo;re taking lessons there are no rounds.
Well, I&rsquo;ll be a learner, for a while.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He carried out his plan to the letter, almost.
After giving him a few words of instruction,
Red invited him to &ldquo;Sail right in. Hit me if
you can.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The boy did not exactly &ldquo;sail in.&rdquo; Instead,
he danced about the big man in an awkward
but tantalizing fashion. There is nothing more
irritating than a fly buzzing around one&rsquo;s head.
Johnny was, for the moment, Red McGee&rsquo;s
fly. He was here, there and everywhere. At
times he appeared to leave himself wide open
to one of Red&rsquo;s sledge-hammer blows, but none
of these really connected.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_123">[123]</div>
<p>All the time Johnny was thinking, &ldquo;How
long will he stand this? How long? How&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>The answer came sooner than he expected.
His arms were all but at his side, he was looking
Red squarely in the eyes when he saw
those eyes change. It was like the change of
a traffic light from green to red. Of a sudden,
a huge gloved paw came squarely at the side
of his head.</p>
<p>No one will ever know what that blow
might have done had it arrived at its proposed
destination. It did not arrive. Johnny&rsquo;s head
was not there. Instead, it was Red who, to his
vast surprise, received the lightest of taps on
the tip of his chin.</p>
<p>The crowd saw and roared. There were
men, plenty of them, who knew that, had Johnny
not pulled that punch, Red would have hit
the floor.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_124">[124]</div>
<p>Did Red know? For the life of him Johnny
could not tell. One thing he did know, this
was no longer a boxing lesson, nor was it to
be a sparring match. It was instead to resemble
an old-fashioned fight with no gong, no
referee and no time out. Red McGee was
aroused. There could be no doubt about that.</p>
<p>Johnny kept his opponent going about the
ring in a whirl. Twice he stopped and all but
fell into Red&rsquo;s waiting fists. Twice he heard
the whistle of a glove as it brushed his ear.</p>
<p>Once, when he was in Blackie&rsquo;s corner, he
heard a hoarse whisper, &ldquo;Steady, there, boy.
I can&rsquo;t afford to lose you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Once, in a mad rush, Red McGee tripped,
falling to his knees. Backing away into a corner,
Johnny gave him time to regain his feet.
Gladly would the boy have remained in that
corner for the count of a hundred. All too soon
he caught Red&rsquo;s challenge.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come out an&rsquo; box.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Red&rsquo;s in a tight place,&rdquo; Blackie said in a
low tone to Lawrence. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m almost sorry I
got him into it. He&rsquo;s got a bull by the tail and
can&rsquo;t let go. If he quits now he&rsquo;s afraid he&rsquo;ll
lose the respect of his men. If he goes on,
well, anything may happen.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In the end two things happened. Both were
surprises to Johnny.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_125">[125]</div>
<p>The older man was tiring. Johnny found
that by using a little strategy he could tap the
man&rsquo;s chin at will. Be it said to his credit, he
tapped that round red chin only twice. There
is little to be gained by an unnecessarily large
score.</p>
<p>Those two taps, little heavier than love pats,
stirred up something deep in Red&rsquo;s nature.
His men were looking on a new man. Not that
they thought the less of him for it. Rough and
ready men of the northern wilds, they understood
as few ever do.</p>
<p>Then things began to happen fast. Red
lunged at Johnny. The boy dodged. The man
came at him again. In one of those seconds
when reason goes on a vacation, Johnny tried
one more pulled punch to the chin. He did
not pull it fast enough. Red McGee fell upon
that punch as a polar bear falls upon a spear.</p>
<p>There came a resounding thwack. Then,
doubling up like an empty sack, Red McGee
spread himself neatly on the floor. He was out
for much more than the count of ten.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_126">[126]</div>
<p>The hush that followed was appalling. But
the shout that followed! Nothing Johnny had
ever before heard even remotely resembled it.
Perhaps a gladiator in the Roman Arena, had
he returned from the dead, might have recognized
it with joy or fear.</p>
<p>In vain did Johnny try to analyze that
sound. Was it a cheer? Or was it a curse?
Should he be carried out like a football hero
or crushed by an infuriated mob?</p>
<p>Strangely enough, as he stood there half
paralyzed by the sudden shock of it all, he
was conscious of one voice. Above the shout
had risen a woman&rsquo;s scream. And he had not
known there was a woman in the place. Who
was she? Where had she come from? Why
was she here?</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s all right, boys,&rdquo; he heard a big voice
boom. &ldquo;He didn&rsquo;t aim to do it. He pulled his
punch. Twice he did it. He&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_127">[127]</div>
<p>The speaker broke off short. There was a
girl at his side, or perhaps a young lady. Johnny
was not sure. A round, freckled face and
angry eyes, that was all he saw. In another
second she would have been at him, tooth and
nail. But the big foreman, who had done the
talking, wrapped a long arm about her waist
as he said, &ldquo;It&rsquo;s all right, Rusty. Everything
is O. K., child. He didn&rsquo;t aim to do it. An&rsquo;
your daddy ain&rsquo;t hurt none to speak of. It&rsquo;s
what they call a knockout. He&rsquo;ll be &rsquo;round in
a twinkle.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At that the girl hid her face in the foreman&rsquo;s
jacket to murmur fiercely, &ldquo;The brute! The
ugly little brute!&rdquo;</p>
<p>And Johnny knew she meant him. Because
she was a girl, because he had hurt her and he
felt miserable, he slipped back into the outer
fringe of the milling throng.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_128">[128]</div>
<h2 id="c12"><span class="small">CHAPTER XII</span>
<br />A PTARMIGAN FEAST</h2>
<p>As Red McGee opened his eyes he found the
foreman, Dan Weston and his daughter,
Rusty, bending over him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wh-what!&rdquo; he exclaimed, struggling to
a sitting position, &ldquo;what in the name of&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You fell into a fast one, Red.&rdquo; The foreman
laughed. The crowd joined in this laugh
but not the girl. Sober of face, she stood looking
down at her father.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Daddy,&rdquo; she began, &ldquo;are you&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you mean to say that kid from the
<i>Stormy Petrel</i> put me out?&rdquo; Red McGee interrupted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, you went out,&rdquo; the foreman drawled.
&ldquo;The boy was the only one near you so I
reckon&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>He was not allowed to finish for at that Red
McGee let out a tremendous roar of laughter.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_129">[129]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Ho! Ho! Ha-ha-ha!&rdquo; he roared. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s
one on Red McGee.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But, boys!&rdquo; he struggled to his feet. &ldquo;I
want to admit right here. There might be
something to that <i>Stormy Petrel</i> crew after all.
Give &rsquo;em a chance, I say.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure! Sure!&rdquo; the crowd boomed. &ldquo;Give
&rsquo;em a chance.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where&rsquo;s that young roughneck?&rdquo; Red demanded,
staring about him. &ldquo;I want to shake
his hand.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here&mdash;here he is!&rdquo; Blackie pushed Johnny
forward.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&mdash;I&rsquo;m sorry&mdash;&rdquo; Johnny began.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Young man,&rdquo; Red McGee broke in, &ldquo;never
apologize. Your enemies don&rsquo;t deserve it, and
your friends don&rsquo;t demand it. From now on
we&rsquo;re pals. Shake on it.&rdquo; Their hands met in
the clasp of a grizzly and a bear cub.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s more,&rdquo; Red went on, &ldquo;the treat&rsquo;s
on me. You&rsquo;re coming up to dinner with me,
all four of you fellows from the <i>Stormy Petrel</i>.
Ever eat ptarmigan pot pie?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Never have,&rdquo; said Johnny.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, you&rsquo;re going to before this day is ...&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_130">[130]</div>
<p class="center"><span class="gs">* * * * * * * *</span></p><p>... look into her eyes, he found himself seeing
cold, blue-gray circles expressing as near as
he could tell, undying hate.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course,&rdquo; he said to Blackie, &ldquo;you can&rsquo;t
expect a girl to understand about boxing, with
all of its ups and downs. But it does seem she
might give a fellow the benefit of the doubt.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She will, son. She will,&rdquo; Blackie reassured
him. &ldquo;Perhaps sooner than you think.&rdquo; Was
this prophesy or a guess? Time would tell.</p>
<p>Rusty McGee was the type of girl any real
boy might be proud to call a pal. With an
easy smile, a freckled face and a mass of wavy,
rust-colored hair, she caught your interest at
a glance. The strong, elastic, healthy spring
of her whole self kept you looking.</p>
<p>More than once during his visit to the
McGee summer home, a stout log cabin nestling
among the barren Alaskan hills, Johnny
found his eyes following her movements as
she glided from room to room.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Boy, she can cook!&rdquo; Blackie exclaimed as
he set his teeth into the juicy breast of
&ldquo;mountain quail,&rdquo; as ptarmigan are often
called. And Johnny did not disagree.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_131">[131]</div>
<p>Since the crew of the <i>Stormy Petrel</i> were her
father&rsquo;s friends, it was evident that Rusty meant
to do her best as a hostess. But to Johnny
she gave never a smile.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How she must love that old dad of hers!&rdquo;
Blackie whispered once. Johnny&rsquo;s only answer
was a scowl.</p>
<p>Yes, Johnny was shunned and slighted by
this youthful &ldquo;queen of the canneries,&rdquo; as she
had once been called, but the <i>Stormy Petrel&rsquo;s</i>
engineer, old Hugh MacGregor, came in for
more than his full share of interest.</p>
<p>Hugh MacGregor was truly old. His thatch
of gray told that. With grandchildren of his
own he was just a big-hearted old man. Rusty
was not long in sensing that.</p>
<p>When the dinner, a truly grand feast, was
over, the others, Blackie, Red McGee, Lawrence
and Johnny retired to the glassed-in
porch where they might have a look at the barren
hills of Alaska and the wide, foam-flecked
sweep of Bristol Bay, and, at the same time,
talk of fish, Oriental raiders and the sea.</p>
<p>MacGregor remained behind to &ldquo;help with
the dishes.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_132">[132]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Do you like Alaska?&rdquo; Rusty asked him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, sure I do!&rdquo; was the old man&rsquo;s quick
response. &ldquo;I spent a winter much further north
than this many years ago. I was quite young
then. It was thrilling, truly it was. Cape
Prince of Wales on Bering Straits&mdash;&rdquo; his voice
trailed off dreamily.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Way up there?&rdquo; the girl exclaimed. &ldquo;What
were you doing?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Herdin&rsquo; reindeer and Eskimo,&rdquo; he laughed.
&ldquo;I crossed the straits in a skin boat with the
Eskimo and lived a while in Russia without a
passport. You do things like that when you
are young.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah yes,&rdquo; he sighed, &ldquo;youth is impulsive,
and often wrong.&rdquo; He was thinking of Johnny.
He knew how Johnny felt about things.
He had become very fond of the boy.</p>
<p>Did Rusty understand? Who could tell?
Burying her hands in foamy suds, she washed
dishes furiously. Nor did she speak again for
some time.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, over their pipes, Red McGee and
Blackie were discussing the task that lay before
them.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_133">[133]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I suppose you know all about this Oriental
fishing business,&rdquo; Red suggested.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not sure that I do know all about it,&rdquo;
was Blackie&rsquo;s modest reply. &ldquo;Suppose you tell
me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s like this,&rdquo; Red cleared his throat.
&ldquo;There was a time when we thought the salmon
supply off these shores was inexhaustible.
We caught them in nets and traps just as we
pleased.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then,&rdquo; he blew out a cloud of smoke, &ldquo;there
came a time when we woke up to the fact that
the whole run of salmon might vanish. You
know what that would mean?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I know,&rdquo; Blackie agreed. &ldquo;The little
man in Hoboken, Omaha and Detroit who
hasn&rsquo;t much pay and has a big family could
no longer feed the children on a fifteen-cent
can of salmon.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_134">[134]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Right,&rdquo; McGee agreed. &ldquo;More than that,
thousands of fine fellows, just such men as
you saw tonight, fair-minded, honest men that
would,&rdquo; he paused to chuckle, &ldquo;that would see
one of their best friends knocked cold by a
stranger in a fair sparring match and not want
to kill him, men like that would be out of a
job. Their families would go hungry. You
know, about all they understand is salmon
catching.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And so?&rdquo; Blackie prompted after a moment&rsquo;s
silence.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So the government and the canners got
together on a conservation program; so many
fish to be caught each year, the same number
allowed to go up stream and spawn.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The plan was well worked out. We&rsquo;ve put
the salmon industry on a sound foundation.
It will continue so for years unless&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;These Orientals are allowed to come over
here and set three-mile-long nets across the
bay,&rdquo; suggested Blackie.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s just it!&rdquo; McGee struck the table a
resounding blow. &ldquo;They&rsquo;re taking advantage
of a technicality of international law. And
unless we drive them out&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not too loud,&rdquo; Blackie cautioned. &ldquo;There
goes one of them now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What?&rdquo; McGee sprang to his feet. A slender,
dark-haired person was passing down the
path before the cabin.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_135">[135]</div>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; he settled back in his place. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s
not one of &rsquo;em. He&rsquo;s one of our Eskimos. We
have three of them down here. It&rsquo;s a little off
their regular beat. But they are keen at locating
the runs of salmon. Inherited it from their
fathers, I&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But say!&rdquo; his voice rose. &ldquo;He does look
like one of those Orientals.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure he does,&rdquo; Blackie agreed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We might use him for a sort of spy,&rdquo; McGee&rsquo;s
voice dropped to a whisper. &ldquo;His name&rsquo;s
Kopkina. Used to work in a restaurant. He
picked up the Oriental lingo, at least enough
to pass for one of &rsquo;em. If some of them come
around here, we&rsquo;ll have Kopkina mix in with
them. He might find things out, important
facts.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a good idea,&rdquo; Blackie agreed.</p>
<p class="tb">&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; MacGregor was saying to Rusty, as
he told more of his adventures in the very far
north, &ldquo;it was a bit peculiar goin&rsquo; up there
like that, livin&rsquo; with the Eskimos. And me
still a young fellow like Johnny Thompson
now.&rdquo; He shot her a look. She smiled at him
in a peculiar way, but said never a word.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_136">[136]</div>
<p>&ldquo;It was the food that was strange,&rdquo; he went
on after a chuckle. &ldquo;Of course, you can chew
polar bear steak if you&rsquo;ve got uncommon good
teeth. Seal steak&rsquo;s not half-bad and reindeer
makes a grand Mulligan stew.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I know,&rdquo; the girl agreed. &ldquo;We have
some reindeer meat sent down every season.
Stay with us and you&rsquo;ll have a taste of it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll stay, all right,&rdquo; MacGregor declared.
&ldquo;That&rsquo;s what we&rsquo;re here for to stay, hunting
Orientals and shadows&mdash;shadows.&rdquo; He repeated
the word slowly. &ldquo;Blackie believes in
moving shadows in the fog on the sea.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Shadows?&rdquo; the girl stared at him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure! He says they glide along across the
sea with never a sound. Like some phantom
schooner it was,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s strange.&rdquo; The girl&rsquo;s eyes shone.
&ldquo;There was a gill-net fisherman last season
told something just like that. He was an Italian,
sort of a dreamer. We didn&rsquo;t believe him.
But now&mdash;what do you think?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know what to think,&rdquo; MacGregor
scratched his gray thatch.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_137">[137]</div>
<p>&ldquo;But, Mr. MacGregor,&rdquo; the girl said after
a moment, &ldquo;didn&rsquo;t you have a thing to eat except
Eskimo food?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What? Oh, yes, up there, up there when
I was a kid same as Johnny,&rdquo; MacGregor
laughed. &ldquo;Sure&mdash;sure we did. It came on a
sailin&rsquo; schooner all in cans.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We had evaporated potatoes and eggs in
cans, butter pickled in cans, hot dogs in cans,
everything. And the Eskimos,&rdquo; he threw back
his head and laughed. &ldquo;They&rsquo;d stand around
watchin&rsquo; to see what we&rsquo;d take out of a can
next.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And then we got a phonograph,&rdquo; he
laughed again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A phonograph?&rdquo; Rusty said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure. First one those little brown boys ever
seen. Had a long tin horn to it, that phonograph
did. The Eskimos looked at it and
tapped the tin horn. They said, &lsquo;<i>Suna una?</i>&rsquo;
(What is it?) We didn&rsquo;t tell &rsquo;em, so they
tapped it some more and said, &lsquo;All same tin
can-<i>emuck</i>.&rsquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_138">[138]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Bye and bye we cranked it up and started
it going. The record was a white man singin&rsquo;
&lsquo;Meet me in Saint Louis, Louie. Meet me at
the Fair.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, that was funny!&rdquo; he chuckled. &ldquo;The
Eskimos just looked and listened for a long
time. Then one of them looked at the others
and said, &lsquo;Can you beat that! A white man
in that tin can!&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>The merry laugh that rang out from the
kitchen was heard by those on the porch.
Johnny heard it with the others and was glad&mdash;glad
that that fine girl could laugh even if
it wasn&rsquo;t his joke.</p>
<p>&ldquo;See that cannery out there?&rdquo; Red McGee
was saying. &ldquo;Cost a cool million dollars. Paying
interest on the investment, too. Also it&rsquo;s
giving two thousand people a living. But these
Orientals with their floating canneries&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Floating canneries?&rdquo; Lawrence broke in.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure! That&rsquo;s what they&rsquo;ve got. They pick
up some big hulk of a ship cheap, install some
canning equipment, load on a drove of cheap
coolies and steam away. Pretty soon they&rsquo;re
over Bristol Bay, just off the shores of Alaska,
but beyond the three-mile limit. Three miles!
Bah!&rdquo; he exploded.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_139">[139]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m in favor of calling every square mile
of Bristol Bay American waters,&rdquo; Blackie replied.</p>
<p>Red McGee stared at him with sudden approval.
&ldquo;Say!&rdquo; he roared, &ldquo;we must be brothers.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We ought to run those Orientals off,&rdquo;
Blackie grinned. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re here to start just
that. That boat of ours may not seem so hot,
but she&rsquo;s got speed and power, three airplane
motors in her. Good ones, too. Once we sight
an Oriental fishing boat setting nets too close
behind the fog they&rsquo;re coming ashore.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;To do a lot of explaining.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, and for quite a long visit.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the talk,&rdquo; Red McGee stood up.
&ldquo;Here&rsquo;s hoping the wind drops so you can get
there. The fishing hasn&rsquo;t really started. No
foreign boats have been seen. But they&rsquo;re
there. They made a haul last year. We&rsquo;re sure
of that. So why shouldn&rsquo;t they come back?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why not?&rdquo; Blackie agreed.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_140">[140]</div>
<p>In all of this time neither Johnny nor Lawrence
said a word. For all that, they were
thinking hard and their young hearts were
on fire with a desire to do their bit for the good
old U. S. A. and Alaska, their present home.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nice place you&rsquo;ve got here,&rdquo; said MacGregor,
as he joined the party on the porch.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It will pass,&rdquo; was Red McGee&rsquo;s modest reply.
&ldquo;I built it for my wife. She loved these
rugged hills and the smell of the sea. She&mdash;&rdquo;
his voice faltered. He looked away. &ldquo;She left
us a year and a half ago. But Rusty and I,
we&mdash;we sort of carry on.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But if those Orientals&mdash;&rdquo; his voice rose,
&ldquo;Oh! Well, enough of that for today. It&rsquo;s
good of you fellows to join us in a feast!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s been swell!&rdquo; said Blackie.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Swell! Grand! Mighty keen!&rdquo; were the
impulsive comments of the boys.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We know each other better,&rdquo; said Blackie.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A whole lot better,&rdquo; Red McGee agreed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Goodbye, Rusty,&rdquo; MacGregor called back
through the house.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Goodbye! Goodbye! Come again soon,&rdquo;
came back in a girlish voice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wonder,&rdquo; Johnny thought as he took the
winding path leading down to the wharf.
&ldquo;Wonder if we&rsquo;ll ever get to come back here?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_141">[141]</div>
<h2 id="c13"><span class="small">CHAPTER XIII</span>
<br />THE SHADOW</h2>
<p>&ldquo;Fog.&rdquo; There was more than a suggestion
of disgust in Johnny&rsquo;s tone as he
said this word. It was the next morning.
After a good night&rsquo;s sleep aboard the <i>Stormy
Petrel</i> he felt ready for anything. The moment
he awoke he had listened for the pounding
surf.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gone!&rdquo; He had leaped from his bunk.
&ldquo;Storm&rsquo;s over. Now for a good look at Bristol
Bay and perhaps, just perhaps, some of those
Orientals.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here&rsquo;s hoping,&rdquo; Lawrence agreed.</p>
<p>Yes, the storm was over, but here instead
was a damp, chilling blanket of dull, gray fog.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t see a hundred feet,&rdquo; he grumbled.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_142">[142]</div>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll get used to that, son.&rdquo; It was Red
McGee who spoke. He had been leaning on
the rail talking to Blackie. &ldquo;&lsquo;Men and Fog on
the Bering Sea.&rsquo; That&rsquo;s the name of a book.
And it&rsquo;s a good name. There are always men
and nearly always there is fog.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fish are coming in,&rdquo; he added as a cheering
note. &ldquo;Two boats are just in from a try
at the gill-nets. They made a fair catch.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But this fog,&rdquo; Johnny insisted, &ldquo;gives those
Orientals a chance to slip in close, doesn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It does!&rdquo; Red agreed. &ldquo;Blast their hides!
That floatin&rsquo; factory of theirs comes in close
to the three-mile limit. Then their other boats,
small, fast ones, can come over the line and
set nets. You couldn&rsquo;t see them in the fog.
They&rsquo;d put &rsquo;em up early. Three miles of nets.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Claim they&rsquo;re catchin&rsquo; crabs. Crabs, me
eye!&rdquo; he exploded. &ldquo;Crab nets are set on the
bottom. Salmon nets are set close to the top.
Drift nets are what they use. We&rsquo;ve never
found one inside the three-mile line, but we
think they&rsquo;ve been there all the same.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you ever do find one,&rdquo; he turned to
Blackie, &ldquo;take it up and bring it in. We&rsquo;ll can
their fish an&rsquo; boil their nets.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_143">[143]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Shouldn&rsquo;t be any three-mile line,&rdquo; he continued.
&ldquo;All our shore water belongs to us.
So do the fish. It&rsquo;s food, son! Food for the
millions. And these Orientals would have had
fish on their own shores if they hadn&rsquo;t exterminated
them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re going out right now,&rdquo; said Blackie.
&ldquo;Going to have a look for that shadow that
passes in the fog. We&rsquo;ve got a nice swivel
cannon up there forward. Don&rsquo;t know whether
you can hit a shadow, but it won&rsquo;t do any
harm to try.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All the same, this <i>is</i> a serious situation,&rdquo;
said Blackie as they headed out into the fog.
&ldquo;These Alaskans are a strange people. They
are like the men of the old west, the west that&rsquo;s
gone forever; fearless men with hearts of gold,
fighting devils when they know they&rsquo;ve been
wronged. And this Oriental raiding business
is an outrage, providing it&rsquo;s true.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But is it true?&rdquo; Johnny asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That,&rdquo; said Blackie, &ldquo;is what we&rsquo;re going
to find out.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Johnny,&rdquo; he said after a moment, &ldquo;go up
forward and remove that box. Let our little
brass messenger swing with the boat.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_144">[144]</div>
<p>A moment later, up forward, a small swivel
cannon swung from side to side. As it did so
it seemed to point, first right, then left.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This way or that?&rdquo; Johnny thought. &ldquo;I
wonder which it will be.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Hour after hour the fog hung on. Hour
after hour Johnny squinted his eyes for some
moving object in that blanket of gray fog.
The cold, damp ocean air chilled him to the
bone. Stamping his feet, he held doggedly to
his post. When his watch was over he went
below to soak in the heat of the stove that
George, the colored cook, kept roaring hot. He
drank two cups of scalding black coffee,
downed a plate of beans and a whole pan of
hot biscuits, then spread himself out on a cushioned
seat to close his eyes and dream.</p>
<p>In those dreams he saw creeping gray shadows,
darting fish and a pair of laughing eyes.
The eyes closed. When they opened the face
wore a frown.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Rusty!&rdquo; he whispered. &ldquo;Wonder if she&rsquo;ll
ever forgive me?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_145">[145]</div>
<p>All too soon his turn at the watch came.
The days were long, twenty hours from dark
to dawn. By nature a hard driver, inspired by
his desire to help the Alaskans, Blackie steered
his small craft endlessly through the gray
murk.</p>
<p>Then&mdash;of a sudden Johnny rubbed his eyes&mdash;stared
away to the right&mdash;closed his eyes&mdash;snapped
them open again to whisper hoarsely,</p>
<p>&ldquo;Blackie! The shadow passes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The shadow! Where?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The boy&rsquo;s hand pointed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;As I live!&rdquo; Blackie muttered.</p>
<p>A short, slim line, little darker than the fog,
moved slowly across the spot where sky and
sea should meet.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ahoy, there!&rdquo; Blackie roared. &ldquo;What boat
goes there?&rdquo;</p>
<p>No answer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll show them!&rdquo; Blackie put out a hand.
Three powerful motors roared. The <i>Stormy
Petrel</i> lurched forward, all but throwing Johnny
into the sea.</p>
<p>Sudden as the movement was, it proved too
slow. Like a true shadow, the thing vanished
into the murk.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&mdash;it went down,&rdquo; Johnny stammered.
&ldquo;Must have been a whale.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_146">[146]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Or a submarine,&rdquo; Lawrence suggested.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It did not go down,&rdquo; said MacGregor. &ldquo;It
slid away into the fog. And it was not a whale.
I&rsquo;ve seen plenty of whales. They&rsquo;re never like
that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wait!&rdquo; Johnny sprang for the cannon.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll give them a shot just to let them know
we&rsquo;re after them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No! No! Not that!&rdquo; MacGregor waved
him back. &ldquo;&lsquo;Speak softly and carry a big
stick.&rsquo; That was Teddy Roosevelt&rsquo;s motto.
The grandest president that ever lived. There&rsquo;s
time enough to make a noise after we&rsquo;ve got
&rsquo;em under our thumb.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&mdash;I&rsquo;m sorry,&rdquo; said Johnny.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_147">[147]</div>
<h2 id="c14"><span class="small">CHAPTER XIV</span>
<br />A VOICE IN THE FOG</h2>
<p>Forty-eight long hours the <i>Stormy
Petrel</i> haunted the gray fog. During far
more than his fair share of that time, eyes
blinking but tireless, Johnny stood on deck
studying the small circle of black waters.</p>
<p>Three times his heart leaped as a dark bulk
loomed before them. Three times he heaved a
sigh of disappointment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Only one of the gill-net boats returning to
the cannery,&rdquo; was the answer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;re running strong,&rdquo; was the joyous
report of one fisherman. &ldquo;Full load first trip.
Looks like a grand season.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Poor luck,&rdquo; came from the second. &ldquo;We
tried hard. Got only half a load. Have to
come in anyway. It&rsquo;s the rule. Fish must always
be fresh.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The third boat had had even worse luck. It
was going back all but empty.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_148">[148]</div>
<p>&ldquo;No new calico dress for Nancy this time,&rdquo;
the youthful skipper groaned.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No gitta da dress,&rdquo; his Italian companion
agreed.</p>
<p>At last, out of gas, with her crew half-blind
from watching, the <i>Stormy Petrel</i> headed for
the harbor.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;re out there somewhere,&rdquo; Red McGee
insisted, as he met them at the dock.
&ldquo;Must be anchored up north of here somewhere.
It&rsquo;s the boys who go up that way who
come back half-empty.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But the wheels are turning,&rdquo; he added with
a touch of pride. &ldquo;Ever see a cannery in operation?&rdquo;
he turned to the boys.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, never have,&rdquo; was the quick response.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Rusty,&rdquo; said Red, turning to his daughter,
&ldquo;how&rsquo;d you like to show these boys through
our plant?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Did Johnny detect a frown on the girl&rsquo;s
face? If so, it was gone like the shadow of a
summer cloud.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure! Come on!&rdquo; she welcomed. They
were away.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_149">[149]</div>
<p>Somewhere Johnny had heard that a fish
cannery was a place of evil smells and revolting
sights. Dirty coolies gouging into half-rotten
fish&mdash;that was his mental picture.</p>
<p>A surprise awaited him. Not a coolie was
in sight. The place smelled as fresh as a May
morning. To his ears came the sound of rushing
water.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where are the coolies?&rdquo; he asked a man
beside a machine.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is him,&rdquo; the man chuckled. &ldquo;An iron
coolie.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As the two boys watched they saw the machine
seize a large salmon, sever its head and
tail, remove the scales and fins, clean it and
pass it on in a split second.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jimminy crickets!&rdquo; Lawrence exploded.
&ldquo;And I used to think I was the champion fish
cleaner!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Rusty favored him with a gorgeous smile.</p>
<p>When, a little later, Johnny made a try for
that same young lady&rsquo;s smile, the cloud once
again passed over her face, but no smile. He
was not, however, entirely discouraged. It
was, he thought, more as if she could not forgive
him than that she did not want to.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_150">[150]</div>
<p>&ldquo;We saw the shadow pass,&rdquo; Lawrence confided
to the girl, as at last they stood before a
canning machine.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; the girl breathed. &ldquo;Did you? And
what&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It vanished into the fog.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have a small motor-boat,&rdquo; the girl said,
in evident excitement. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s the <i>Krazy Kat</i>.
I&mdash;I&rsquo;m going out to look for the shadow in the
fog.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&mdash;you&rsquo;d better not do that,&rdquo; Johnny
spoke before he thought. &ldquo;You&rsquo;d be&mdash;&rdquo; He
did not finish.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was practically born and raised here.&rdquo;
She spoke to him, as an old-time Alaskan
might to a newcomer.</p>
<p>Johnny did not resent it. He had spoken
out of turn. And yet he was disturbed. He
did not care to think of this fine young creature
out there in the fog alone. Supposing she
did find the Orientals setting nets. Suppose
they found her, alone out there in the fog?</p>
<p>&ldquo;None of my business,&rdquo; he told himself
fiercely. &ldquo;Just none at all.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_151">[151]</div>
<p>The <i>Stormy Petrel</i> remained an entire day in
port. Blackie spent his time listening to reports
from the various fishing grounds. The
shores of Bristol Bay are hundreds of miles
long. Next time he went out he wanted to go
to the right spot, if there were such a spot.</p>
<p>Johnny made the acquaintance of Kopkino,
the Eskimo. From him he learned much about
salmon, Orientals and the shores of Bristol
Bay. And then, just at midnight, he passed
the sturdy little man standing beside a dark
pathway. There were three little men with
him and they were all talking. They were not
Eskimos. He was sure of that. But they were
Orientals. He had heard enough of the languages
to know.</p>
<p>At once his mind was filled with questions.
Was Kopkino betraying his employer for Oriental
gold, or was he acting as a spy for his
big white brother? Who could say?</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s an Oriental,&rdquo; Johnny told himself.
&ldquo;All Eskimos are. But after all&mdash;&rdquo; He came
to no conclusion.</p>
<p>Just before dawn the <i>Stormy Petrel</i> crept out
into the fog. She was bound for an unannounced
destination.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_152">[152]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Action,&rdquo; Johnny said to Lawrence. &ldquo;This
time we are to have action. I feel it in my
bones.&rdquo;</p>
<p>One thing puzzled Johnny not a little. They
were provisioned as if for a long trip, two
weeks or more.</p>
<p>Several hours later the <i>Stormy Petrel</i> was
once again circling about in the fog.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Seems like it&rsquo;ll never end, this fog,&rdquo; MacGregor
said to Johnny. They were on deck
working out their watch. &ldquo;Looks as if nature
was on the side of those Orientals.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Orientals,&rdquo; he continued musingly, &ldquo;I
don&rsquo;t suppose they&rsquo;re much different from the
rest of us, only just some of them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just some of them,&rdquo; Johnny agreed, giving
the wheel a turn.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come to think of it,&rdquo; MacGregor went on,
&ldquo;there are a few white men who are not so
honorable.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Quite a few,&rdquo; Johnny agreed.</p>
<p>Truth is, Johnny was dead tired. He wanted
nothing quite so much as to crawl into some
warm corner and sleep for hours and hours.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_153">[153]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t hate them all the same,&rdquo; MacGregor
squinted his eyes to look through the fog.
Then he demanded low, &ldquo;Hear anything,
Johnny?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not a thing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thought I heard a voice coming out of the
fog.&rdquo;</p>
<p>For some time after that neither spoke.
They were listening with all their ears for
some sound that might tell them the mysterious
moving shadow was about to pass.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is this shadow?&rdquo; Johnny asked himself.
&ldquo;Submarine, some fast, silent craft, or a
whale?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He liked the idea of a submarine. The Orientals
had them. Why not use them for laying
nets? Easy enough to vanish when danger
was near.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hate, me lad, is destructive,&rdquo; the aged
man&rsquo;s voice was solemn as he took up the
thread of conversation he had dropped. &ldquo;Hate
destroys you as well as the people you hate.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He broke off short to cup a hand behind his
ear.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There <i>was</i> a voice,&rdquo; he insisted in a hoarse
whisper.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_154">[154]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I heard it,&rdquo; Johnny replied, tense with
sudden excitement.</p>
<p>Ten minutes had passed. They were beginning
to relax when the sound came again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Over to the right,&rdquo; MacGregor shrilled.
&ldquo;Turn her about quarterin&rsquo; them. Give her top
speed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Right.&rdquo; Johnny twisted the wheel. The
motors roared. It was a bold step that might
have led to disaster. Should there be a boat
out there setting nets, and should they crash
at that speed, what would it mean? Johnny
did not dare to think.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There!&rdquo; MacGregor gripped the boy&rsquo;s
arm.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh&mdash;ah!&rdquo; Johnny groaned. &ldquo;We missed
them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was true. Off to the left, for the space of
seconds, they saw an unmistakable dark, gray
bulk. And then it was gone.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Our own speed defeated us,&rdquo; declared MacGregor.
&ldquo;Ah, well, better luck next time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Or worse,&rdquo; Johnny grumbled.</p>
<p>Had he but known it, it was to be worse,
much worse.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_155">[155]</div>
<p>&ldquo;As for me,&rdquo; MacGregor said a half hour
later, resuming his talk, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t hate anybody.
It&rsquo;s not worth while. Sometimes I hate the
things they do. Mostly, I try to think of good
people and the good things they do.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And that,&rdquo; his voice rose, &ldquo;that&rsquo;s what I
like about this job of ours. If we can drive
these Orientals from our shores we&rsquo;ll be doing
good to our own people, a whole lot of &rsquo;em.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Know what I see when I&rsquo;m tired and I
close my eyes?&rdquo; he asked suddenly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No. What?&rdquo; Johnny grinned good-naturedly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Children,&rdquo; MacGregor said in a mellow
tone. &ldquo;Children playing before an open fire
and their mother puttin&rsquo; the crust on an apple
pie in the kitchen. And those, Johnny, are the
children and wives of men way up here scoutin&rsquo;
around in the cold and fog for salmon.
We&rsquo;re servin&rsquo; them, Johnny, or at least we&rsquo;re
trying to.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Just then Blackie&rsquo;s head popped up out of
the hatch.</p>
<p>&ldquo;See anything?&rdquo; he demanded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Plenty,&rdquo; said Johnny.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_156">[156]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, an&rsquo; heard &rsquo;em,&rdquo; MacGregor added.</p>
<p>They told Blackie what had happened.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So you think you heard them?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Think?&rdquo; MacGregor roared. &ldquo;We <i>know</i>
we heard &rsquo;em.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Might have been a seal barking to his mate,
or mebby a loon. You can&rsquo;t be sure. Question
is, if they&rsquo;re here, where&rsquo;s their nets?&rdquo;
Blackie came up on deck.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Turn the boat north by east,&rdquo; he said to
Johnny. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re going in for a rest.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Rest? What&rsquo;s that?&rdquo; Johnny opened up a
grand smile.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Something we don&rsquo;t have much of,&rdquo; said
Blackie. &ldquo;But this fog burns your eyes. You&rsquo;re
no good when you&rsquo;ve been out too long.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s a cabin on shore if only we can
find it,&rdquo; he explained. &ldquo;A trapper&rsquo;s place, snug
and warm. Red McGee told me about it.
Trapper&rsquo;s gone south with his furs. We&rsquo;re to
make ourselves at home.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_157">[157]</div>
<p>Make themselves at home they did. After
tying the <i>Stormy Petrel</i> up at a narrow dock
they helped George up to the cabin with kettles,
pans and food supplies. Then, while a
jolly wood fire roared in the huge stove made
of a steel gasoline barrel, laid on ends, they
sprawled out on rustic chairs to sniff the odor
of roasting beef and baking pies and to dream
dreams.</p>
<p>With his eyes closed, MacGregor was seeing
&ldquo;children and their mothers putting the
top crust on apple pies.&rdquo; In his dream Blackie
held a struggling Oriental by the collar of his
coat and the seat of his trousers. As for Johnny,
he was seeing a round, freckled face all
rosy with smiles. Then, to his dismay he was
seeing that same face take on a somber look.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Rusty,&rdquo; he thought once again. &ldquo;Will she
ever forgive me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The feast George had prepared was one fit
for a king or even a big league baseball player,
and the sleep they had in that cabin resting
among the bleak Alaskan hills was the soundest
Johnny had known for many a day. Well
it was that this should be, for Fate had much
in store for him.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_158">[158]</div>
<h2 id="c15"><span class="small">CHAPTER XV</span>
<br />A ROAR FROM THE DEEP</h2>
<p>&ldquo;It will be an hour or two before I can get
out,&rdquo; Blackie said next morning, standing
up to stretch himself before the fire. &ldquo;I
want to go over some maps Red McGee gave
me. Lawrence can draw up a simple chart that
will keep us going right.</p>
<p>&ldquo;MacGregor,&rdquo; he turned to the aged Scotchman.
&ldquo;How would you like to take Johnny
for a circle or two in the fog? You might discover
some evidence. It&rsquo;s nets we want most.
If we can discover some of those nets inside
the three-mile limit it will help a lot.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Like nothin&rsquo; better,&rdquo; said MacGregor.
&ldquo;Come on, Johnny, let&rsquo;s get goin&rsquo;.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_159">[159]</div>
<p>MacGregor had spoken for both of them.
Johnny was fond of the engineer. He was old,
mellow and kind, was MacGregor. This, he
had confided to Johnny, was to be his last year
with the service. Another twelve months and
he would be pensioned. &ldquo;And, Johnny,&rdquo; he
had added, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m as eager as any boy to have a
part in something big before I am compelled
to go.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hope you can have,&rdquo; had been Johnny&rsquo;s
heartfelt wish.</p>
<p>So now, with the sun still low and the fog,
it seemed, thicker than ever before, they
slipped out of the snug little natural harbor
into the great unknown that is any sea in time
of fog.</p>
<p>Standing at the wheel, Johnny watched the
dark circle of water about them. Ever they
moved forward, yet never did this circle grow
larger. It was strange.</p>
<p>There was life at this circle. Now a whole
fleet of eider-ducks, resting on their way north,
came drifting into view. With a startled
quack-quack they stirred up a great splatter,
then went skimming away.</p>
<p>And now a seal with small round head and
whiskers like a cat came to the surface to
stare at them.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_160">[160]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Not worth much, that fellow,&rdquo; was MacGregor&rsquo;s
comment. &ldquo;Not much more hair than
a pig.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But look, Johnny!&rdquo; his voice rose. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s
a real fur seal. His hide&rsquo;s worth a pretty penny.
Wouldn&rsquo;t have it long either, if those
Orientals sighted him. We used to have a hot
time with &rsquo;em over the seals. Had to pay &rsquo;em
to get &rsquo;em to leave the seals alone. That was
a shame. Have to do the same with the salmon,
like as not. We&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look, Johnny! What&rsquo;s that?&rdquo; His voice
suddenly dropped to a whisper, as if he believed
the fog had ears. &ldquo;Right over to the
left, Johnny. Ease &rsquo;er over that way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Another seal,&rdquo; said Johnny.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s no seal,&rdquo; MacGregor whispered. &ldquo;Johnny!&rdquo;
His whisper rose. &ldquo;We got &rsquo;em. It&rsquo;s a
net marker. Inside the three-mile limit. An&rsquo;
it&rsquo;s none of Red McGee&rsquo;s net markers either.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&mdash;that&rsquo;s right,&rdquo; the boy breathed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And there&rsquo;s the floats, Johnny! There they
are!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sure enough, leading away into the fog was
a wavering line of dots.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_161">[161]</div>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll follow it,&rdquo; was MacGregor&rsquo;s instant
decision. &ldquo;See how much net there is, then&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll follow it,&rdquo; Johnny agreed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Set the boat to go five miles an hour. I&rsquo;ll
time you.&rdquo; MacGregor pulled out his large,
old-fashioned watch. &ldquo;Now we&rsquo;ll see.&rdquo;</p>
<p>For a full ten minutes, in silence, the two of
them watched the apparently never-ending
line of net floats appear and disappear into the
fog.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Near two miles of it,&rdquo; MacGregor growled.
&ldquo;And yet no end. No wonder some of our fine
boys come in with empty boats. These Orientals,
they just find a place outside where the
salmon run an&rsquo; head &rsquo;em off. They&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Slow up, Johnny!&rdquo; he warned. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s
the end. Shut off the motor.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The motor ceased to purr. Silence hung
over the fog. A seal bobbed up his head, then
ducked. A large salmon, caught in the net
close to the surface, set up a feeble splatter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ease about,&rdquo; said MacGregor. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll pick up
that net with this pike pole.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now,&rdquo; he breathed, leaning far out over
the rail, &ldquo;now I got her. Now&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_162">[162]</div>
<p>He had succeeded in getting his hands on
the marker when catastrophe came thundering
up at them from the deep. A tremendous explosion
sent the water rocketing toward the
sky. The prow of the <i>Stormy Petrel</i> rose until
it seemed she would go completely over.</p>
<p>Frantically Johnny gripped the wheel to
save himself from being plunged into the icy
water. But where was MacGregor?</p>
<p>For ten tense seconds the boat stood with
prow in air. Then with a slow, sickening
swash, she came down.</p>
<p>&ldquo;MacGregor!&rdquo; Johnny cried. &ldquo;What happened?
Where are you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here&mdash;here I am!&rdquo; MacGregor&rsquo;s voice rose
from the sea.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Johnny!&rdquo; his voice was hoarse with emotion.
&ldquo;Shove off that life boat. Get her off
just any way. There&rsquo;s a terrible hole in the
<i>Stormy&rsquo;s</i> side. She&rsquo;ll sink in another minute.
For God&rsquo;s sake, be quick!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Johnny was quick and strong. If ever his
strength stood him in good stead it was now.</p>
<p>The life boat hung over the afterdeck. The
knots of ropes that held it in place were wet
and stiff with fog.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_163">[163]</div>
<p>&ldquo;No time,&rdquo; he muttered. With his knife he
slashed away the ropes. The boat fell on deck
with a thud. It was a heavy steel boat. To
his consternation, he saw that it had fallen
squarely between the heavy rails. The prow
must be lifted. Creeping under it, he put all
the strength of his back against it. It rose.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now!&rdquo; he breathed. &ldquo;Now! And now!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The boat was on the rail. He could fairly
feel the <i>Stormy&rsquo;s</i> deck sinking beneath him.
She was doomed, there was no doubt of that.
Those heavy motors would take her down fast.</p>
<p>Once again he heaved. The life boat was
now a quarter over the rail, now a third, now
half.</p>
<p>Leaping from beneath it, he executed a double
movement, a shove and a leap. He was
in the life boat. The life boat plunged, all but
sank, swayed from side to side, then righted
herself.</p>
<p>There was a low, sickening rush of water.
Johnny looked. The <i>Stormy</i> was gone. In her
place were swirling water and in the swirl an
odd collection of articles; a coat, a cap, a pike
pole, and MacGregor&rsquo;s checkerboard.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_164">[164]</div>
<p>&ldquo;MacGregor!&rdquo; Johnny called hoarsely.
&ldquo;MacGregor! Where are you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here! Over here!&rdquo; was the cheering response.
&ldquo;I had to get away. She would have
sucked me down.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Seizing an oar, Johnny began sculling the
boat. In a moment he was alongside his companion.
A brief struggle and MacGregor,
watersoaked and shivering, tumbled into the
boat.</p>
<p>&ldquo;John&mdash;Johnny,&rdquo; his teeth were chattering.
&ldquo;There&mdash;there shou-should be d-d-dry clothes
in the stern.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dragging a half barrel from the prow, Johnny
pulled out shirts, underclothing, trousers,
socks and shoes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Seems you were looking for this,&rdquo; he
chuckled as he watched the plucky old man
disrobe himself.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Johnny,&rdquo; said MacGregor. &ldquo;In the Coast
Guard service you are always looking for it an&rsquo;
all too often you&rsquo;re not disappointed.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_165">[165]</div>
<p>When, a few minutes later, after a brisk
rub-down, MacGregor had struggled into dry
clothes and had succeeded in lighting his pipe,
he said, &ldquo;Well, me boy, we thought we had &rsquo;em
an&rsquo; now they&rsquo;ve got us. We&rsquo;re miles from
anywhere in a fog. And that&rsquo;s bad! Mighty
bad.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you suppose Blackie heard it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What? The explosion? &rsquo;Tain&rsquo;t likely.
We&rsquo;re all of four miles from there. Don&rsquo;t forget,
we followed that net two miles. An&rsquo; that
explosion was muffled by the water.</p>
<p>&ldquo;An&rsquo; if he heard,&rdquo; he added after a brief
pause, &ldquo;what could he do? He&rsquo;s four miles
away. No compass. An&rsquo; no boat except maybe
a fishing skiff. No, Johnny,&rdquo; his voice
sounded out solemn on the silent sea. &ldquo;For
once in our lives we are strictly on our own,
you and me.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, me lad,&rdquo; he murmured a moment
later. &ldquo;They got us that time. Attached some
sort of bomb to their net, that&rsquo;s what they did.
Safe enough in a way, too, for how you goin&rsquo;
to prove it was their net? Yes, they got us.
But you wait, me lad, we&rsquo;ll be gettin&rsquo; them
yet.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_166">[166]</div>
<h2 id="c16"><span class="small">CHAPTER XVI</span>
<br />LOOMING PERIL</h2>
<p>Many times in his young life Johnny
had been on his own, but never quite
like this.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not a bit of good to row,&rdquo; was MacGregor&rsquo;s
decision. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve not the least notion
which way to go. If there was a breeze we
might row by that. There&rsquo;s no breeze.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No sun, moon or stars, either,&rdquo; Johnny
agreed.</p>
<p>For a full half hour they sat there in silence.
Off in the distance a seal barked. Closer at
hand an eider-duck quacked to his mate. A
sudden scream, close at hand, startled them
for an instant. It was followed by a wild laugh.
They joined in the merriment. It was only a
loon.</p>
<p>There came a wild whir of wings. A flock
of wild ducks, flying low and going like the
wind, shot past them.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_167">[167]</div>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s north,&rdquo; Johnny exclaimed. &ldquo;They&rsquo;re
going due north to their nesting place. That&rsquo;s
east,&rdquo; he pointed. &ldquo;All we have to do is to row
that way. We&rsquo;ll come to land.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you kept your course, which you
couldn&rsquo;t,&rdquo; MacGregor chuckled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s worth trying. Anyway, I&rsquo;m cold,&rdquo;
Johnny began to row. &ldquo;There may be other
bird flights to set me right.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There were not, at least not for fifteen minutes.
When at last a pair of loons with long
necks stretched straight before, passed them,
to his disgust, Johnny saw that the boat was
headed due north.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; he sighed, dropping his oars, &ldquo;At
least I&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Listen!&rdquo; MacGregor put up a hand.</p>
<p>Johnny listened. &ldquo;Say! That&rsquo;s no seal.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nor a bird either. That&rsquo;s a human sound.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Like someone trying to start a motor.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>For a time the sound ceased. Then it began
again.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_168">[168]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Over to the left.&rdquo; Once again Johnny took
up the oars. This time he rowed slowly, silently.
No telling whose motor had stalled. Fisherman,
trapper, or Oriental? Who could tell?</p>
<p>Four times the sound ceased. Four times
Johnny&rsquo;s oars rested on the surface of the
water.</p>
<p>When, at last, a small, dark spot appeared
on the surface of the sea, Johnny fairly ceased
to breathe.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Heck!&rdquo; said a voice in that fog.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Doesn&rsquo;t sound like an Oriental,&rdquo; Johnny
whispered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fisherman nor trapper either,&rdquo; replied
MacGregor.</p>
<p>Leaning even more gently on his oars, Johnny
sent his boat gliding forward. Then, of a
sudden, he dropped his oars to stare.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s that girl, Rusty,&rdquo; he whispered hoarsely.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The same,&rdquo; MacGregor agreed.</p>
<p>There could be no doubt about it. The girl
was bending over to give her flywheel one
more turn. Over her boy&rsquo;s shirt, high boots
and knickers she had drawn a suit of greasy
coveralls. On her face, besides a look of grim
determination, there was a long, black smudge.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_169">[169]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Heck!&rdquo; she exclaimed once more.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Havin&rsquo; motor trouble?&rdquo; MacGregor spoke
aloud.</p>
<p>The girl started so suddenly that she all but
lost her balance. Then, after a brief spell of
unbelieving silence, she said, &ldquo;It&rsquo;s you, Mr.
MacGregor! How glad I am to see you! I&rsquo;ve
been lost for hours. I&mdash;I went out to hunt the
Shadow, that shadow you know. My motor&rsquo;s
stalled. But now&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now we&rsquo;re all lost together,&rdquo; MacGregor
chuckled.</p>
<p>To Johnny, the girl gave never a second
look.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do&mdash;do you suppose you could start it?&rdquo;
she said to MacGregor, nodding at her motor.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No harm to try. At least we&rsquo;ll come aboard
for a cup o&rsquo; tea,&rdquo; MacGregor chuckled.</p>
<p>Johnny rowed the lifeboat alongside the
girl&rsquo;s boat, the <i>Krazy Kat</i>, and they climbed
aboard.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s not gittin&rsquo; gas,&rdquo; said MacGregor,
after he had turned the motor over twice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know,&rdquo; the girl&rsquo;s brow wrinkled.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_170">[170]</div>
<p>Without saying a word, Johnny scrambled
back to the box covering the gas tank. After
lifting the box off, he struck the tank a sharp
rap. The tank gave off a hollow sound.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You might try putting some gas in your
tank,&rdquo; he said with a sly grin.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, but there must be gas!&rdquo; the girl exclaimed.
&ldquo;There must be.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps,&rdquo; said Johnny. &ldquo;But it&rsquo;s empty.
May be a leak.&rdquo; Drawing a small flashlight
from his pocket, he bent over and examined
the offending tank.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yep,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;there is a leak, a small hole,
but big enough. Your gas is in the bottom of
the boat, along with the bilge water. Any
reserve supply?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not a bit.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, then, here we are.&rdquo; Johnny took a
seat. &ldquo;Now we have two boats and there are
three of us. The motor-boat won&rsquo;t go, but&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Suddenly he sprang to his feet. &ldquo;You&rsquo;d have
a compass, wouldn&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ye-es,&rdquo; the girl replied with evident reluctance,
&ldquo;but it&mdash;it&rsquo;s out of order. That&rsquo;s why
I got lost.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_171">[171]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Well, anyway,&rdquo; Johnny said with forced
cheerfulness, &ldquo;now there are three of us.
Two&rsquo;s company and three&rsquo;s a crowd. I always
have liked crowds. Besides,&rdquo; the corners of his
mouth turned up, &ldquo;you&rsquo;ve got something of a
cabin.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes.&rdquo; The girl seemed, for the moment,
to forget that she was speaking to one
who had knocked her beloved daddy out. &ldquo;Yes,
there is a cabin. There&rsquo;s a small stove and&mdash;and
some wood. There&rsquo;s tea and some pilot
biscuits.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A stove, wood, tea and pilot biscuits?&rdquo;
Suddenly MacGregor seized her and waltzed
her about in a narrow circle. &ldquo;Rusty, me child,
you are an angel.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A half hour later found them comfortably
crowded into Rusty&rsquo;s small cabin. They were
sipping tea and munching hard round crackers.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The fog&rsquo;ll lift after a while,&rdquo; MacGregor
rumbled dreamily. &ldquo;We lost our boat. That&rsquo;s
bad. But there&rsquo;s marine insurance. That&rsquo;s
good. We&rsquo;ll have another boat. I wonder,&rdquo;
he paused to meditate, &ldquo;wonder what Blackie
and the others are thinking by now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And doing,&rdquo; Johnny suggested uneasily.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_172">[172]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, and doin&rsquo;,&rdquo; MacGregor agreed.</p>
<p>A half hour later, growing restless, Johnny
crept from his corner, opened the cabin door
and disappeared up the narrow hatch.</p>
<p>Ten seconds later he poked his head into the
door to exclaim in a low, tense voice, &ldquo;MacGregor,
come up here quick.&rdquo;</p>
<p>MacGregor came. The girl came too. For
a full half minute the three of them stood there
speechless. They were looking up and away.
Their eyes were wide and staring.</p>
<p>&ldquo;MacGregor,&rdquo; Johnny asked, &ldquo;what is it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A ship,&rdquo; MacGregor whispered. &ldquo;A thunderin&rsquo;
big ship. She&rsquo;s not two hundred leagues
away. She&rsquo;s not movin&rsquo;, just driftin&rsquo;. That&rsquo;s
how she came close to us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wha-what ship is she?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who knows, son? But I&rsquo;d lay a bet I could
guess the country she came from.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So&mdash;so could I.&rdquo; Johnny&rsquo;s throat was dry.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&mdash;we,&rdquo; Rusty pulled her old sou&rsquo;wester
down hard on her head, &ldquo;we&rsquo;d better get into
the life boat and row away. It&mdash;it doesn&rsquo;t matter
about the <i>Krazy Kat</i>. It really doesn&rsquo;t.&rdquo;
She swallowed hard.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_173">[173]</div>
<p>&ldquo;We can try it,&rdquo; MacGregor agreed. &ldquo;But
I&rsquo;m afraid it&rsquo;s too late.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; he added with a low, rumbling
laugh. &ldquo;We were lookin&rsquo; for &rsquo;em. Now we
found &rsquo;em, we don&rsquo;t want &rsquo;em. Come on, an&rsquo;
mind you, never a sound!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_174">[174]</div>
<h2 id="c17"><span class="small">CHAPTER XVII</span>
<br />TRAPPED</h2>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s no use. We&rsquo;re in for it.&rdquo; Five minutes
later MacGregor dropped his oars.
From some spot close to that dark bulk against
the sky had come the throb of a motor.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Rusty, me child,&rdquo; the old man&rsquo;s voice was
very gentle. &ldquo;Be sure those golden locks of
yours are well tucked in. Whatever you do,
don&rsquo;t remove that sou&rsquo;wester. For the present
you are a boy. You must not forget.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&mdash;I won&rsquo;t forget.&rdquo; Rusty&rsquo;s fingers were
busy with her hair.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I only hope,&rdquo; the old man added soberly,
&ldquo;that my guess is wrong.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Scarcely were the words out of his mouth
when a smart little motor boat, bright with
red and white paint, hove into view. And on
the deck, scarcely less smart in brass buttons
and braid, stood a small man with slanting
eyes.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_175">[175]</div>
<p>Those eyes appeared a trifle startled at sight
of MacGregor. &ldquo;A thousand pardons.&rdquo; The
little man&rsquo;s voice was smooth as oil. &ldquo;What
is that which you wish?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Only a few gallons of gasoline,&rdquo; said MacGregor.</p>
<p>The lightning change on the little man&rsquo;s
face was startling. It was as if a dagger had
suddenly flashed from his belt, yet his tone
was smooth as before.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah! You are out of gas? Very unfortunate.
Your line, please. We shall escort you
to our ship.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But we don&rsquo;t want to go to your ship,&rdquo;
MacGregor protested. &ldquo;All we want is gas.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, yes, a thousand apologies. But here
there is no gasoline, only at the ship. Your
line, please.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Say, you&mdash;&rdquo; Johnny&rsquo;s angry voice was
stopped by a heavy pressure on his arm.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Give him our line, son,&rdquo; said MacGregor.</p>
<p>Grudgingly Johnny obeyed. A moment
later, with the two boats in tow, the bright,
little craft went rolling back toward that
broad, black bulk.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_176">[176]</div>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s no use to quarrel with &rsquo;em,&rdquo; MacGregor
said in a sober whisper. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve fallen
into their hands. I think that chap recognized
me. I&rsquo;ve been along the Pacific waterfronts
for many years. So have these Orientals.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But&mdash;but what will happen?&rdquo; Rusty asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who knows?&rdquo; was MacGregor&rsquo;s sober reply.
&ldquo;Let us hope for the best. They&rsquo;ll not let
us go now. When they&rsquo;re well beyond the
three-mile limit they may give us gas and let
us go.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In the meantime, Rusty,&rdquo; he warned, &ldquo;don&rsquo;t
forget you&rsquo;re a boy. It&rsquo;s a good thing you&rsquo;ve
got on knickers instead of a dress.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They were brought alongside. A ladder was
let down. They climbed aboard. There they
were ushered before one more small man who
wore even more brass and braid. Johnny
thought with a touch of humor that he would
make a very fine monkey if only he had a cap,
a tin cup and a string.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_177">[177]</div>
<p>When MacGregor requested that they be
given gasoline and allowed to leave, there were
excuses, very profuse and polite, but quite formal.
There were reasons, very unfortunate
reasons; too much fog, a storm coming up, too
few men to spare even one or two, to find the
way alone quite impossible. Oh, quite!</p>
<p>The man, who beyond doubt was the captain,
talked on and on.</p>
<p>It all ended by the <i>Krazy Kat&rsquo;s</i> being hoisted
on board, by the little party drinking very
black and very hot tea with the much adorned
captain, and at last by their being escorted,
for all the world as if they were embarking on
a long voyage, to a pair of staterooms on the
second deck.</p>
<p>For a time after the stateroom doors had
been closed the surprised trio stood staring
first at one another and then at their surroundings.</p>
<p>The two staterooms were joined by a door.
There were two berths in each stateroom.
There were round portholes, no other windows.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That will be your stateroom, Rusty,&rdquo; MacGregor
opened the door to the one beyond.
&ldquo;Keep your outside door locked.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_178">[178]</div>
<p>&ldquo;One thing more,&rdquo; hesitatingly he produced
a pair of scissors, &ldquo;I always carry them,&rdquo; he
explained. &ldquo;A man doesn&rsquo;t live everywhere as
I have done, not in Alaska, without learning
to cut hair. I&rsquo;m a fair hand at it. Rusty, me
child, those rusty red locks of yours have got
to come off.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Without a word the girl dropped to a stool
beside the berth.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Johnny,&rdquo; said MacGregor, &ldquo;I suggest that
you step outside and stand guard. Don&rsquo;t leave
the door, not more than three steps. If anyone
comes near, make some noise on the door.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Right,&rdquo; said Johnny.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Rusty,&rdquo; said MacGregor, &ldquo;do you ever
box?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh yes, often.&rdquo; The girl&rsquo;s face flushed.
&ldquo;Often. Daddy and I box by the hour.&rdquo; She
gave Johnny a strange, fleeting look.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good!&rdquo; MacGregor exclaimed low. &ldquo;Tonight
we&rsquo;ll have an exhibition match, just you
and Johnny. Two boys showing these Orientals
how to play.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And now,&rdquo; he nodded his head toward the
door.</p>
<p>Johnny opened it ever so softly, peered
through the crack, and was gone.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_179">[179]</div>
<p>At the same moment the old man lifted the
shabby sou&rsquo;wester from the mass of lovely
hair, blew on his scissors, heaved a heavy sigh,
then slashed with apparent ruthlessness at a
great handful of perfectly natural, copper-colored
curls.</p>
<p>A half hour later the door opened a crack.</p>
<p>Taking the cue, Johnny stepped inside. He
stopped short when he looked at Rusty.</p>
<p>It was with the greatest difficulty that he
suppressed a smile at what he saw. The sou&rsquo;wester
was no longer needed. Good old MacGregor
had done his work well. Rusty&rsquo;s hair
looked like a real boy&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What a grand boy!&rdquo; Johnny thought. And
after that, &ldquo;What a perfect brick of a girl she
is!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mac,&rdquo; he said a moment later, &ldquo;there are
twenty thousand fine big red salmon up forward.
I stepped around a hatchway far
enough to see.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_180">[180]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Twenty thousand,&rdquo; the old man murmured.
&ldquo;Our boys get fourteen cents apiece just for
catchin&rsquo; &rsquo;em. Twenty-eight hundred dollars.
A grand livin&rsquo; for two happy families. And
that&rsquo;s the first haul. There&rsquo;ll be many another
unless someone stops &rsquo;em.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And we won&rsquo;t stop &rsquo;em,&rdquo; he added with a
touch of sadness. &ldquo;Not just yet. But you
wait!&rdquo; he sprang to his feet. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll get a
break yet.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_181">[181]</div>
<h2 id="c18"><span class="small">CHAPTER XVIII</span>
<br />FIVE ROUNDS AND A FRIEND</h2>
<p>It may seem a little strange that MacGregor
and his young companions accepted the
whole situation so calmly. Yet the old man
had lived long and in many places. He was
wise in the ways of the world. He realized
that they had already seen too much to be
released at once. How long would they be
detained? To this question he could form no
answer. Perhaps until the end of the legal
fishing season, twenty or more days away.
Perhaps longer. They might even be taken to
the Orient. After that some fantastic story
might be told of their being picked up adrift
on the high seas.</p>
<p>Johnny was thinking along these same lines.
But he, unlike MacGregor, was already laying
plans for escape. For the present, however,
he was willing to bide his time.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_182">[182]</div>
<p>Dinner was brought to them by a smiling
little brown man. It was not a bad meal, as
meals go on the sea&mdash;boiled rice, baked salmon
and tea.</p>
<p>When it was over, MacGregor slipped out
into the gathering night. While he was gone
not a word was spoken. Johnny was busy with
his own thoughts. So, he supposed, was the
girl who now looked so very much like a boy.</p>
<p>He was thinking, &ldquo;I wonder if there were
shadows passing us in the fog. Or did we
imagine them?&rdquo; Certainly he had seen nothing
resembling a shadow here. And this girl.
Would she forgive him? Well enough he knew
that in trying times such as these people were
either drawn closer together or driven farther
apart. He could only wait and see.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s hope in the airplane that young
Dan MacMillan is bringing up,&rdquo; he thought
with fresh courage. &ldquo;If only he&rsquo;d arrive and
fly over this ship we&rsquo;d manage somehow to
signal him and then the whole navy would be
on this old freighter&rsquo;s heels.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_183">[183]</div>
<p>He was thinking now of something told to
him in secret by Red McGee. He had been
speaking of the cannery. It had been built by
old Chad MacMillan. A crusty, honest, fair-dealing
man, he had managed it for many
years.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then he died,&rdquo; Red had gone on, &ldquo;and
young Dan MacMillan, just out of university
and full of big ideas, inherited it. This winter
I suggested that he hire a seaplane to go out
scouting for these Oriental robbers.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;It&rsquo;s a fine idea,&rsquo; he said to me. &lsquo;A grand
idea. I&rsquo;ll buy a seaplane and learn to pilot it.
You&rsquo;ll be seeing me up there scouting around
as soon as the salmon season opens.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s what he said to me,&rdquo; Red McGee
had drawn in a deep breath. &ldquo;These wild
young millionaires! What can you expect?
He&rsquo;s not here now and like as not won&rsquo;t show
up at all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What can you expect?&rdquo; Johnny was thinking
over his words now. &ldquo;If only Dan MacMillan
showed up over this old craft all these
little brown men would be scared out of their
skins.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But would he come? He dared not so much
as hope.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_184">[184]</div>
<p>He wondered about Lawrence and Blackie.
He suffered a pang because of Lawrence.
What a shame that he had dragged the boy
up here! He would be far better off in Matanuska
valley planting turnips and potatoes,
hunting wild geese, and, perhaps, catching a
glacier bear way back in the mountains.</p>
<p>But here was MacGregor. And he carried
in his hands, of all things, two pairs of boxing
gloves. Johnny had wondered where they were
to come from, but now here they were.</p>
<p>&ldquo;These little brown boys go in strong for
boxing,&rdquo; the old man explained.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I told them,&rdquo; continued MacGregor, &ldquo;that
you were one of America&rsquo;s most promising
young boxers, but a little out of training.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Quite a little,&rdquo; Johnny agreed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I said you and your boy pal would put on
an exhibition match on deck tonight.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Rusty shot him a look, but said never a
word.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hope you understand,&rdquo; the old man said
soberly, &ldquo;that I am asking you to do this for
your own good.&rdquo; He was talking to Rusty.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_185">[185]</div>
<p>She bowed gravely. Then, of a sudden, her
face brightened. &ldquo;I hope they take us lightly,&rdquo;
she said. &ldquo;That may give us a chance to escape.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s what it will,&rdquo; MacGregor agreed.
&ldquo;And this boxin&rsquo; stunt is just the thing to put
them off their guard.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A half hour later, beneath a brilliant electric
light, with a circle of dark faces about them,
Johnny and Rusty shook hands for the first
time in their lives, then drew on the gloves.</p>
<p>Johnny had boxed strange people in many
an out-of-the-way place. Never before had he
boxed with a girl. He was not sure he was
going to like it now. But with MacGregor as
manager of the strange affair, there was no
turning back.</p>
<p>It <i>was</i> strange, there was no getting around
that. A swaying light, a host of sober, brown
faces, the gray fog hanging over all, made it
seem fantastic indeed.</p>
<p>There were to be five short rounds with
MacGregor keeping time.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_186">[186]</div>
<p>At the very beginning, Johnny discovered
that his opponent was fast and skillful. Having
no sons, Red McGee had taken it upon
himself to train his daughter in the manly art
of boxing. Life on the bleak Alaskan shore
was often dull. The girl had welcomed each
new lesson. And now Johnny was discovering
that her punches that from time to time
reached his cheek or chin, were far from love
pats. They really stung, nor, try as he would,
could he entirely escape them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s taking it out on me because of her
father,&rdquo; he thought grimly. &ldquo;Well, I can take
it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>What did the audience think of this affair?
Who could tell? They watched in silence.
Once when Rusty was tossed into their midst
they helped her to her feet and pushed her
into place. Their movements were so gentle,
the flitting smiles about their lips so friendly,
that, for the moment, the girl forgot her role
and said, &ldquo;Thank you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The rounds passed speedily. When the
fourth and last was up, Johnny said in a whisper,
&ldquo;Come on, Rusty, let&rsquo;s make this one
snappy. Give them a real show.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_187">[187]</div>
<p>Snappy it was. From the moment MacGregor
gave them the signal they whipped
into it with a wild swinging of gloves. Rusty&rsquo;s
footwork was perfect. Johnny found himself
admiring the manner in which, hornet-like,
she leaped at him for a sharp, stinging blow,
then faded away.</p>
<p>Perhaps he was admiring her too much.
However that might be, in the last thirty seconds
of the bout he stepped into something.
Trying for a bit of reprisal in the way of a
tap on her chin, he left an opening far too
wide. Rusty&rsquo;s eyes opened wide, her stout
right arm shot out and up. It took Johnny
squarely under the chin and, &ldquo;believe it or
not,&rdquo; he went down and out like a match.</p>
<p>He was not out long, perhaps eight seconds.
When at last his stubborn eyelids opened he
found himself looking at a circle of grinning
brown men and at Rusty who stood staring
at him, but not smiling at all.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; he laughed, &ldquo;that must square the
McGee&rsquo;s with Johnny Thompson.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;John&mdash;Johnny, please!&rdquo; she cried. &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t
mean to. I truly didn&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right.&rdquo; Johnny sprang to his feet.
&ldquo;Shake on it. Let&rsquo;s always be friends.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_188">[188]</div>
<p>The girl made no response. There was no
need. She did clasp his hand in a grip that
was friendly and strong.</p>
<p>A half hour later they were having one
more cup of tea in their staterooms and Johnny
was thinking, &ldquo;Life surely is strange. I
wonder how this affair will end.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Before he fell asleep he went over it all
again. Blackie and Lawrence, the silent, moving
shadow, the hard-working men on shore,
the airplane that might come. When he was
too far gone in sleep to think clearly he fancied
that he felt the ship&rsquo;s propeller vibrating, that
the ship was on the move. He was not sure.
After all, what did it matter? There was nothing
he could do about it. And so, he fell fast
asleep.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_189">[189]</div>
<h2 id="c19"><span class="small">CHAPTER XIX</span>
<br />ORDERED BELOW</h2>
<p>Back in the trapper&rsquo;s cabin Blackie was
in a rage. He stormed at the Orientals,
at MacGregor, then at himself. From time to
time he rushed out on the small dock in a vain
attempt to pierce the thick fog and to listen
with all his ears.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The robbers have got them,&rdquo; he muttered.
&ldquo;I should have known. That shadow! It&rsquo;s
done for them and for the <i>Stormy Petrel</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As night came on he settled down to sober
thinking. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s a fishing skiff out there by
the dock,&rdquo; he said to Lawrence. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll have
to put it in the water and make a try for the
mainland. This cabin is on an island. Mainland
must be thirty miles away. We&rsquo;ll make
it. We&rsquo;ll find some sort of power boat. And
then, by thunder! Things will get to popping!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_190">[190]</div>
<p>Lawrence, too, was disturbed in his own
quiet way. He knew a great deal about Johnny.
Many a time Johnny had been in a tight
spot. Always, somehow, he had come out safely.
MacGregor was old and wise. And, after
all, this was not a time of war. Why need one
worry too much?</p>
<p>There were a number of tattered books on
the shelf in the corner. Evidently this trapper
was something of a naturalist, for five of these
were about animals and birds. In browsing
through these, the boy made a real find, a picture
of a glacier bear, a brief description, and
the history of the animal as far as known.</p>
<p>It was with the feelings of a real discoverer
that he read those words over and over. When
he had finished he said to himself, &ldquo;If ever I
see one of those bears I&rsquo;ll know him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But would he? At the present moment
those bears seemed as far away as the moon.
And yet, who could tell?</p>
<p>At dawn next morning the three of them,
George, the cook, Blackie and Lawrence, carried
their few supplies down to the dock,
tacked a note on the door, climbed into the
broad, clumsy skiff and rowed into the fog.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_191">[191]</div>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll follow the shore as far as we can,&rdquo;
said Blackie. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll have to cross a broad
stretch of open water, but I think I can manage
that with my pocket compass.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When at last Lawrence saw even the small
island disappear from sight, he regretted the
circumstances that appeared to make it necessary
to leave that comfortable retreat.</p>
<p class="tb">When Johnny and his friends came on board
that same morning, they found the fog still
with them, but it was thinner. There was a
suggestion of a breeze in the air.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Going to clear,&rdquo; was MacGregor&rsquo;s prophecy.
This, they were soon to discover, did not
concern them too much, at least not in the
immediate future.</p>
<p>When they had eaten a strange mixture of
rice and meat and had gulped down some very
bitter coffee, a little man with neither gold nor
braid on his uniform came up to them, saluted
in a careless manner and said simply, &ldquo;Come.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They followed him from one deck to another
until they found themselves in a vast place of
steam and evil smells.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_192">[192]</div>
<p>When their eyes had become accustomed to
the light and steam, they saw long rows of
men toiling and sweating over apparently endless
tables. Before the tables, on a conveyor,
thousands of large salmon moved slowly forward.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No iron coolie here,&rdquo; Johnny chuckled.
&ldquo;Everything is done by hand. Heads off, tails,
fins, all with big knives.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Please,&rdquo; said the little man. He was holding
out a long, thin, oilskin coat. Understanding
his wish, Johnny put it on. Still wondering,
he watched MacGregor and the girl follow
his example.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Please,&rdquo; said the little man again. &ldquo;A thousand
apologies.&rdquo; He was holding out three
long, sharp knives, at the same time pointing
with his other hand at a break in the solid
line of salmon workers.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, the dirty little shrimp!&rdquo; Johnny exploded.
&ldquo;He wants us to go to work.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Steady, son,&rdquo; MacGregor warned. &ldquo;They
understand English. I fancy there are worse
places than this on the ship. We have no
choice but to obey.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_193">[193]</div>
<p>Johnny muttered, but dropped into place to
slash off a large salmon&rsquo;s head.</p>
<p>He had worked in a rebellious humor for a
quarter of an hour when, on looking up, he
discovered that Rusty was performing the
most disagreeable task in the salmon line. She
was cleaning the fish. Shoving past MacGregor,
he turned her half about as he muttered
low, &ldquo;You take my place.&rdquo;</p>
<p>To his great astonishment, he felt the girl
whirl back to her place, give him a hard push,
then saw her resume her work.</p>
<p>For a space of seconds he stood there
stunned. Then he laughed low. The girl was
wise, much wiser than he had known. She was
supposed to be a boy. Boys were not gallant
to one another. She would play the part to
the bitter end. Johnny returned to his task.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mac,&rdquo; he was able to whisper at last, &ldquo;why
would they do this to us?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You answer,&rdquo; was the old man&rsquo;s reply.
&ldquo;Sh-sh&mdash;&rdquo; he warned. &ldquo;Here comes a big shot,
one of the monkeys with gold buttons.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As he passed the &ldquo;big shot&rdquo; smiled suavely
at them, but said never a word.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_194">[194]</div>
<h2 id="c20"><span class="small">CHAPTER XX</span>
<br />A BATTLE IN THE DARK</h2>
<p>Even at lunch time the toiling trio, Rusty,
Johnny and MacGregor, were not invited
to have their lunch on deck. Instead,
they were served, like the coolie with whom
they toiled, with great bowls of some mixture
that looked like soup.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hm,&rdquo; MacGregor sighed, &ldquo;fish chowder.
And not bad.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Rusty&rsquo;s eyes shone. &ldquo;What a lark!&rdquo; She
laughed outright. &ldquo;I only wish we had a camera.
My crowd down in Seattle won&rsquo;t believe
me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Johnny looked at her in surprise and admiration.
&ldquo;Here&rsquo;s one girl with a spirit that can&rsquo;t
be broken,&rdquo; he thought.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_195">[195]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Reminds me of a time I was on the Big
Diomede Island on Bering Straits,&rdquo; said MacGregor
with a rumble of merriment. &ldquo;We were
cutting up a big walrus. I saw an old woman
working over the stomach of that walrus.
Know what the walrus lives on?&rdquo; he demanded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Clams,&rdquo; said Johnny.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Right. Bright boy,&rdquo; said MacGregor. &ldquo;The
thing that had happened was this. The walrus
had been down to the bottom. He&rsquo;d ripped
up the sand at the bottom of the sea. He&rsquo;d
cracked a lot of clams and had swallowed &rsquo;em.
He hadn&rsquo;t digested &rsquo;em yet when we shot &rsquo;im.
Know what that Eskimo woman was doing?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t guess.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She had a white pan and was savin&rsquo; the
clams from the walrus&rsquo; stomach. And that
night,&rdquo; there came a low rumble from deep
down in MacGregor&rsquo;s throat, &ldquo;that night we
had seal steak and clam chowder for supper.
An&rsquo; I took seal steak.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;O-oh,&rdquo; Johnny breathed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. MacGregor,&rdquo; Rusty said with a gurgle,
&ldquo;you wouldn&rsquo;t spoil anyone&rsquo;s dinner,
would you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not for the world,&rdquo; was the old man&rsquo;s solemn
avowal.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_196">[196]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Listen,&rdquo; MacGregor held up a hand. &ldquo;I
hear an electric generator going. It&rsquo;s on this
deck. I wonder why? I&rsquo;m going for a little
walk.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;ll chase you back.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s all they can do.&rdquo; He was away.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The ship&rsquo;s beginning to sway a little,&rdquo;
Johnny said. &ldquo;Shouldn&rsquo;t wonder if we&rsquo;d get
a storm.&rdquo; The girl could not suppress an involuntary
shudder.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Johnny,&rdquo; she leaned close to speak almost
in a whisper. &ldquo;When we used coolie labor I
learned to talk with them a little. I&rsquo;ve been
talking to the coolie who cuts off fish&rsquo;s heads
next to me. He says they expect to have a
boatload of fish in a week or ten days. Then
they&rsquo;ll go back to the Orient.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And if we go with them?&rdquo; Johnny breathed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve seen pictures of the Orient.&rdquo; The
girl&rsquo;s eyes were closed. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s gorgeous. It
truly must be.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you think we&rsquo;d get to see anything?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why not?&rdquo; the girl laughed low. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s all
there to see. At least they can&rsquo;t keep us from
dreaming.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_197">[197]</div>
<p>&ldquo;No, they surely cannot.&rdquo; At that Johnny
did some very choice dreaming, all his own.</p>
<p>He was wakened from these dreams by the
return of MacGregor. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s the strangest
thing!&rdquo; he exclaimed. &ldquo;I got a look into that
place. There&rsquo;s a huge generator an&rsquo; it&rsquo;s chargin&rsquo;
batteries.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Batteries!&rdquo; Johnny exclaimed in surprise.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure! Banks and banks of large batteries.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;When submarines go under water,&rdquo; Johnny
spoke slowly, &ldquo;they use batteries for power.
What do you think?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think,&rdquo; said MacGregor. &ldquo;Anyway,
here&rsquo;s our little boss. He wants us to resume
our duties as first-class cleaners of sock-eyed
salmon.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As the day wore on Johnny watched Rusty
ever more closely. The heavy, unpleasant
work, together with the ever-increasing roll
of the ship, was telling. He was not surprised
that, after the day was over and they were
allowed to go to the upper deck, she took his
arm to lean on it heavily.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Johnny, I won&rsquo;t give up. Please help me
not to give up.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_198">[198]</div>
<p>Johnny looked down at her with a reassuring
smile.</p>
<p>As they stepped on deck they found themselves
looking at a new world. Gone was the
fog. In its place was racing blue waters,
flecked with foam.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A storm!&rdquo; the girl shuddered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just too dark to see land,&rdquo; Johnny groaned.
&ldquo;If it wasn&rsquo;t, we might get our location and
then&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then what?&rdquo; she whispered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have some plans. We&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sh&mdash;an officer!&rdquo; she warned.</p>
<p>At the evening meal Rusty ate hard, dry
crackers and drank scalding tea. She was still
putting up a brave struggle against being sea-sick.</p>
<p>When darkness came they went below.
Rusty retired at once. Johnny threw himself,
all dressed, upon his berth, but did not sleep.</p>
<p>An hour later a shadowy figure passed him.
It was Rusty. She was carrying blankets.
Without a sound, he followed her. Arrived
on deck, he saw her at the rail. Understanding,
he dropped down upon a wooden bench.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_199">[199]</div>
<p>After what seemed a long time, she turned
and saw him. Swaying as she walked, she
came toward him to drop down at his side.
She did not say, &ldquo;I am so sick!&rdquo; She was too
game for that and there was no need. He
wrapped her in the blankets. Then they sat
there in silence.</p>
<p>The wind was rising steadily. It went whistling
through the rigging. Ropes banged and
yard-arms swayed. A shadow shot past them,
a watch on duty. Lights shone on the blue-black
sea. It was a truly wild night.</p>
<p>Of a sudden a form stood before them.
Clutching a steel cable, it clung there.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thousand pardons,&rdquo; it hissed. &ldquo;Cannot
stay here. It is forbidden.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My friend is sick. We stay.&rdquo; Johnny felt
his anger rising.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thousand pardons,&rdquo; came once more.
&ldquo;Cannot stay.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Million pardons,&rdquo; Johnny half rose. &ldquo;We
stay.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_200">[200]</div>
<p>A hand reached out. It touched Rusty&rsquo;s
shoulder. That was enough. Johnny leaped
at the man. They went down in a heap. A
second more and Johnny felt a steel clamp
about his neck, or so it seemed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jujitsu,&rdquo; he thought in sudden consternation.
Throwing all his strength into an effort
to break the man&rsquo;s grip, he failed. Coughing,
trying to breathe, failing, strangling, he felt
his strength going when, of a sudden, he
caught the sound of a blow, then felt the hated
arm relax. Ten seconds more and he was free.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&mdash;you hit him,&rdquo; he managed to breathe.
&ldquo;Is he dead?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No&mdash;no. Watch out!&rdquo; the girl warned.</p>
<p>Just in time Johnny caught the man. This
time, gripping him by collar and trousers, he
dragged him from the floor. And then, screaming
like some wild thing, the brown man found
himself hanging out over an angry sea.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Johnny, don&rsquo;t!&rdquo; The girl&rsquo;s hand was on his
arm.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, all&mdash;all right.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Swinging the brown man in, he dropped him
on the deck. Like a scared rabbit, the intruder
went racing off on all fours.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now I&rsquo;ve done it,&rdquo; Johnny groaned as he
dropped back in his place.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps,&rdquo; said Rusty. &ldquo;Still, you can&rsquo;t tell.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_201">[201]</div>
<h2 id="c21"><span class="small">CHAPTER XXI</span>
<br />WALL OF GLASS</h2>
<p>Rusty was not the only one disturbed
by this storm. At the very moment
when Johnny was at grips with the Oriental
on the ship&rsquo;s deck, Lawrence, Blackie and
George were battling for their very lives.</p>
<p>What had happened? The distance from
the trapper&rsquo;s cabin to shore was, they had discovered,
far greater than they had supposed.
When at last the fog cleared they found themselves
far from any shore on a black and
threatening sea.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Might as well keep headed for the mainland,&rdquo;
was Blackie&rsquo;s decision.</p>
<p>Head for the mainland they did. After that,
for hours, with the storm ever increasing in
intensity, they rowed as never before.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_202">[202]</div>
<p>The clumsy oars were rough and hard to
manage. Lawrence&rsquo;s hands were soon blistered.
Tearing strips from his shirt, he bound
them up and rowed on.</p>
<p>Fortune favored them in one thing. They
were going with the wind. Had they been
forced to face into the storm, their boat would
have been swamped at once. As it was, just
as darkness began to fall the skiff began to fill.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lawrence, you start bailing,&rdquo; Blackie commanded.
&ldquo;George and I will row.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ya-as, sir, we&rsquo;ll row. Don&rsquo;t nebber doubt
dat,&rdquo; George agreed. Then he began to sing,</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;Roll, Jordan, roll.</p>
<p class="t0">Oh! Oh! Oh! I want to go dere</p>
<p class="t0">To hear old Jordan roll.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p>Lawrence thought with a shudder that he
might be there to hear Jordan roll before day
dawned.</p>
<p>By constant bailing he was able to keep the
skiff from swamping. So, chilled to the bone,
hoping against hope, he labored on.</p>
<p>When at last they found themselves near to
some shore, his heart failed him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Towering rocks,&rdquo; he groaned.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_203">[203]</div>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s a break in those rocks,&rdquo; said
Blackie. &ldquo;I saw it before dark. We&rsquo;ll follow
along and here&rsquo;s hoping.&rdquo; Once more he put
his stout shoulders to the oars.</p>
<p>A half hour passed, an hour, two hours.
Numb with cold and ready to drop from exhaustion,
Lawrence wondered if Blackie could
have been wrong. Was there a break in that
wall? And then&mdash;he saw it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There!&rdquo; he exclaimed. &ldquo;There it is. Straight
ahead!&rdquo;</p>
<p>He dared not add that it seemed a strange
break. Not very deep, it appeared to give off
an odd sort of glimmer at its back.</p>
<p>Just as they were ready to enter the gap, a
great cloud went over the moon and all was
black.</p>
<p>Steering more from instinct than sight, they
rowed on. To Lawrence, at that moment, the
suspense was all but overpowering. Where
were they going? Could they find a landing?
What was the end to be?</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_204">[204]</div>
<p>One thing was encouraging, the waves in
this place were not so wild. They no longer
dashed into the boat. So with darkness hanging
over them they rowed, for what seemed
an endless time, but could have been only a
few moments, straight on into the unknown.</p>
<p>And then. &ldquo;Man! Oh, man! What was
that?&rdquo; The boat had crashed into an invisible
wall.</p>
<p>Lawrence put out a hand. &ldquo;Glass!&rdquo; he exclaimed.
&ldquo;A wall of glass.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not glass, son,&rdquo; Blackie&rsquo;s voice was low.
&ldquo;A wall of ice. The end of a glacier. This is
a spot where icebergs break off. If one of
them had been jarred loose by the bang of
our boat&mdash;and if they had been sent tumbling
by the sound of a voice&mdash;man! Oh, man! We
would be lost for good and all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Blackie, look!&rdquo; Lawrence spoke in a hoarse
whisper. &ldquo;A light.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a star,&rdquo; said Blackie.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A light,&rdquo; Lawrence insisted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yas, man! A light,&rdquo; George agreed.</p>
<p>Just then the moon came out, revealing a
sloping mountain side. And, close to a shelving
beach was a cabin. The light shone from
that cabin.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! Oh! Lord be praised!&rdquo; George whispered
fervently.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_205">[205]</div>
<p>Ten minutes later, as they drew their boat
up on the beach, the cabin door was thrown
open and a man, holding a candle close to his
face, peered into the darkness to call, &ldquo;You all
come right on up, whoever you all are.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That,&rdquo; said Lawrence in a surprised whisper,
&ldquo;is Smokey Joe.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Smokey Joe, you old bear-cat!&rdquo; Blackie
shouted.</p>
<p>The grizzled prospector let out a dry cackle.
&ldquo;Come on up an&rsquo; rest yerself,&rdquo; he welcomed.
&ldquo;I got a Mulligan on a-cookin&rsquo;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At first Lawrence found it hard to believe
that this was really Smokey Joe. &ldquo;How,&rdquo; he
asked himself, &ldquo;could he come all this way?&rdquo;
As he studied a faded map on the deserted
cabin&rsquo;s wall, however, he realized that the distance
overland was short compared to the way
they had traveled by water.</p>
<p>Joe&rsquo;s Mulligan stew proved a rich repast.
He had killed a young caribou two days before.
There had been bacon and hardtack in
his kit. Besides these, he had found dried
beans and seasoning in the cabin.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_206">[206]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Yep,&rdquo; he agreed, as Blackie complimented
him after the meal was over, &ldquo;hit&rsquo;s plum grand
livin&rsquo; when you sort of git the breaks.</p>
<p>&ldquo;An&rsquo; listen,&rdquo; his voice dropped. &ldquo;Hit&rsquo;s plumb
quare how things git to a comin&rsquo; yer way. Yesterday
I found gold. Struck hit rich, you
might say.&rdquo; From a moose-hide sack he tumbled
a handful of nuggets.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gold!&rdquo; Blackie exclaimed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yup. Hit&rsquo;s might nigh pure gold,&rdquo; the old
man agreed. &ldquo;Nuther thing that&rsquo;s plumb
quare. Hit&rsquo;s nigh onto that little blue bear&rsquo;s
den.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What?&rdquo; Lawrence started up. &ldquo;A blue
bear! A&mdash;a glacier bear?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Reckon you might call &rsquo;em that,&rdquo; the old
man agreed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s been a-stayin&rsquo; in a sort of cave up thar
fer a right smart spell.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How&mdash;how far is it?&rdquo; Lawrence asked almost
in a whisper.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hit&mdash;I reckon hit&rsquo;s&mdash;&rdquo; the old man studied
for a moment. &ldquo;Why, hit&rsquo;s right about three
peaks, a look an&rsquo; a right smart.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What does that mean?&rdquo; Blackie asked in a
surprised tone.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_207">[207]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Wall, you jest climb one of them thar least
mounting peaks,&rdquo; the old man explained.
&ldquo;Then another, an&rsquo; another.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Three peaks,&rdquo; said Blackie.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fer startin&rsquo;,&rdquo; said Smokey Joe. &ldquo;Arter that
you take a look an&rsquo; hit&rsquo;s a right smart furder
than you can see.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps about ten miles,&rdquo; suggested
Blackie after they had had a good laugh,
which Smokey Joe took good-naturedly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Near on to that,&rdquo; the old man agreed.</p>
<p>Long after the old man had rolled himself
in his blankets and fallen asleep Lawrence and
Blackie sat beside the cracked stove talking.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Blackie,&rdquo; Lawrence said in a husky voice,
&ldquo;that little blue bear is worth a lot of money.
The Professor told us he&rsquo;d trade us a tractor
for one. They&rsquo;re rare, about the rarest animals
on earth. There&rsquo;s not one in captivity
anywhere.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That won&rsquo;t help much,&rdquo; Blackie grumbled.
&ldquo;If this wind goes down, we&rsquo;ve got to get out
of here at dawn. Something&rsquo;s happened to
Johnny and MacGregor. We&rsquo;ve got to look
for them.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_208">[208]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; Lawrence agreed. &ldquo;But if the wind
doesn&rsquo;t go down?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll have to stay here,&rdquo; said Blackie.
&ldquo;And,&rdquo; with a low chuckle, &ldquo;we might go
&lsquo;three peaks, a look and a right smart&rsquo; looking
for your blue-eyed bear.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_209">[209]</div>
<h2 id="c22"><span class="small">CHAPTER XXII</span>
<br />DREAMS</h2>
<p>&ldquo;Johnny,&rdquo; Rusty&rsquo;s voice was low, husky
with strangely mingled emotions, &ldquo;when
we are back at the cottage, I&rsquo;ll make a big pan
of ice-box cookies. We&rsquo;ll take them with a big
bottle of hot cocoa. We&rsquo;ll go out on a sunny
rock and have a feast.&rdquo; They were still on
the deck of the rolling ship and it was still
night.</p>
<p>Rusty&rsquo;s voice rose. &ldquo;And such sunshine!
Nowhere in the world is it so glorious.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right,&rdquo; Johnny agreed. &ldquo;Ice-box cookies,
hot chocolate and sunshine. That will be
keen.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_210">[210]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Dreams,&rdquo; he was thinking. &ldquo;How often
when things are hard, very hard, we dream.&rdquo;
As he closed his eyes now he could see dead
salmon in endless rows. He could hear the
monotonous drone of brown men and the endless
wash-wash of the sea. &ldquo;How grand at
times to dream of other things far away!&rdquo; he
said. &ldquo;And what a joy to know of other places
where we have been gloriously happy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; she agreed, &ldquo;that is wonderful. And
Johnny,&rdquo; she went on, &ldquo;we have a home in
Seattle, father and I. It is small, but, oh, so
beautiful! Climbing roses and pine trees.
There&rsquo;s a lake before it. There is a dancing
pavilion not far away where the boys and
girls I know best come. There they swing and
sway to bewitching waltz time. <i>Over the
Waves</i>, <i>Blue Danube</i> and all the rest. Johnny,
will you come sometime and join us there?&rdquo;
Her voice seemed dreamy and far away.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Johnny. &ldquo;Some day I&rsquo;ll come.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But first,&rdquo; he thought savagely, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll see
this infernal boat at the bottom of the sea.&rdquo;</p>
<p>For a time after that they were silent. Once
again they heard the beating of ropes against
spars, the wail of the wind and the dash of
spray on the deck. How was all this to end?</p>
<p>&ldquo;Rusty,&rdquo; Johnny said, &ldquo;I would like to leave
you for a while.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_211">[211]</div>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s something I want to do. You
know,&rdquo; he leaned close, speaking in a hoarse
whisper, &ldquo;there&rsquo;s a hole in the gas tank of your
boat.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, but&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We may get a break. Your boat was put
on deck after two others. That means they&rsquo;ll
have to put her in the water before taking the
others off. If there was gas in her tank we
might slip down to her and get away.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But the gas, Johnny?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There are two large cans in another boat.
I saw them. I&mdash;I&rsquo;m going to plug up that hole
in your tank, then try to fill it from the cans.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They&mdash;they may catch you.&rdquo; Her voice
trembled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll take a chance.&rdquo; He rose without a
sound. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m off. If I don&rsquo;t come back, tell good
old MacGregor.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&mdash;I&rsquo;ll tell him.&rdquo; Her whisper was lost in
the wind. He was gone.</p>
<p>Creeping along the swaying deck, dodging
behind a lifeboat when the watch appeared,
scooting forward, then pausing to listen, he at
last reached the side of the <i>Krazy Kat</i>.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_212">[212]</div>
<p>After securing the cans of gasoline, he lifted
them to the deck of Rusty&rsquo;s small boat. Then,
with a deft swing, he threw himself after the
cans. The deck was wet with fog. Slipping,
he went down in a heap, but made no sound.</p>
<p>Feeling about in the dark, he found the tank
and the leak. A sharpened splinter of wood
stopped the hole.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now the gas,&rdquo; he whispered. This he knew
would be most dangerous of all. Cans have a
way of gurgling and popping in an alarming
manner. The gurgle, he concluded, would not
matter. It would not be heard above the roar
of the wind and the wash of the sea. But the
tinny bangs? Ah, well, he&rsquo;d have to risk it.</p>
<p>When one can was emptied into the <i>Krazy
Kat&rsquo;s</i> tank, he heaved a sigh of relief. The second
was half-emptied when he caught the
sound of footsteps.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The watch!&rdquo; Consternation seized him.
Flattening himself on the deck, he clung to
the still gurgling can.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_213">[213]</div>
<p>The sound of footsteps ceased. His heart
pounded. Was he caught? Seconds seemed
minutes. If the can popped he was lost. Ten
seconds, twenty, thirty&mdash;again the footsteps.
Then they grew indistinct in the distance.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah,&rdquo; the boy breathed.</p>
<p>Just then the all but empty can gave forth
a loud bang!</p>
<p>Johnny jumped, then lay flat, listening with
all his ears. For at least two full minutes he
remained there motionless. The watch did not
return.</p>
<p>With great care he lifted the empty cans
from the deck of the <i>Krazy Kat</i> to toss them
into the foaming sea. Then, stealthily as before,
he made his way back to Rusty&rsquo;s side.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&mdash;I did it,&rdquo; he shrilled. &ldquo;Now for a good
break and we&rsquo;re away.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here&mdash;here&rsquo;s hoping.&rdquo; She drew her hand
from beneath the blankets to grip his own.</p>
<p>&ldquo;MacGregor, what do you think they&rsquo;ll do
to me?&rdquo; Johnny asked an hour later. The
storm had partially subsided. Rusty was feeling
better. They were back in their staterooms.
Johnny had told the old man of the
night&rsquo;s adventure.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s my opinion,&rdquo; said MacGregor, &ldquo;that
you&rsquo;ll be shot at sunrise.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_214">[214]</div>
<p>&ldquo;That won&rsquo;t be so bad,&rdquo; said Johnny, joining
in the joke.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not half-bad,&rdquo; MacGregor agreed. &ldquo;I mind
an Eskimo we shot up there in the far north.
He&rsquo;d killed a white man. The revenue cutter
came along an&rsquo; the judge tried him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;When the judge&rsquo;s decision had been arrived
at, they told this Eskimo to stand up.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, sir, he stood there stiff an&rsquo; straight
as any soldier. He was sure he had been condemned
to die and that he was to be shot.
They&rsquo;re a sturdy lot, those Eskimos.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; MacGregor paused to laugh. &ldquo;They
set a thing up an&rsquo; aimed it at the Eskimo.
Something clicked. The Eskimo blinked. But
nothin&rsquo; else happened.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The white men folded things up and left.
But the Eskimo still stood there, not knowin&rsquo;,
I suppose, whether he was dead or alive.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Know what happened?&rdquo; he concluded.
&ldquo;He&rsquo;d been found innocent and they had taken
his picture.</p>
<p>&ldquo;For all I know,&rdquo; he added, &ldquo;he&rsquo;s livin&rsquo; still
an&rsquo; so&rsquo;ll you be, me boy, forty years from
today.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_215">[215]</div>
<p>&ldquo;What can they do?&rdquo; he demanded. &ldquo;They
don&rsquo;t dare harm us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t trust them too far,&rdquo; said Johnny.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nor I,&rdquo; Rusty agreed.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_216">[216]</div>
<h2 id="c23"><span class="small">CHAPTER XXIII</span>
<br />IN THE BLUE BEAR&rsquo;S CAVE</h2>
<p>It was with a feeling of great uneasiness
that Johnny came on deck next morning.
What was to happen? Had that little brown
man told the story of their struggle in the
night? And if he had? He shuddered.</p>
<p>Yet, strange to say, the day wore on in perfect
peace. They were not even asked to go
below and clean fish. The reason for this was
apparent, the fish on deck had been taken
care of. Since the storm was still roaring
across the sea, no others could be brought in.
During the forenoon two small, motor-driven
crafts came close to stand by.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They belong to this outfit,&rdquo; MacGregor declared.
&ldquo;They may have salmon below-deck.
They&rsquo;re afraid of the storm. That&rsquo;s why they
don&rsquo;t come in.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_217">[217]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, well,&rdquo; he sighed. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re here for the
day at least. Even if your <i>Krazy Kat</i> was in
the water, Rusty, we couldn&rsquo;t risk her in a
storm like this.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;These Orientals are a queer lot,&rdquo; Johnny
mused.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Queer&rsquo;s no name for it, me boy,&rdquo; said MacGregor.
&ldquo;As for me, I don&rsquo;t trust &rsquo;em. They&rsquo;re
like children, just when they&rsquo;re makin&rsquo; the
least noise is when you&rsquo;re sure they&rsquo;re up to
some mischief.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Was this true? Johnny shuddered anew,
but said never a word.</p>
<p>They discovered during their lunch in their
stateroom at noon that there was something
vaguely familiar about the brown boy who
brought the lunch. Johnny stared at him. But
Rusty exclaimed in a whisper, &ldquo;Kopkina! You
here?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The boy made a motion for silence. &ldquo;I am
spy,&rdquo; he whispered. &ldquo;Red McGee good man.
Me, I, Red McGee man.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_218">[218]</div>
<p>&ldquo;You listen,&rdquo; his voice dropped to a whisper.
&ldquo;I tell &rsquo;em, that one captain this ship, tell &rsquo;em
you Red McGee boy.&rdquo; He nodded to Rusty.
&ldquo;Tell &rsquo;em Red McGee mebby plenty mad.
Plenty &rsquo;fraid Red McGee. They not punish
you for fight on deck last night. Must go
now.&rdquo; He disappeared through the door.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Boy!&rdquo; Johnny breathed. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m feeling better
already.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Two hours later they had added cause for
feeling better. Just when the sea was beginning
to calm a little they caught the drum of
a motor. As Johnny heard it his heart stood
still, then leaped.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A motor,&rdquo; he breathed. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s a powerful
motor. If only it&rsquo;s Dan MacMillan and his
seaplane.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is! It is!&rdquo; Rusty&rsquo;s voice rose to a high
pitch. &ldquo;There! There it is. See!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Johnny did see. He pointed it out to MacGregor.
They all leaned on the rail watching
the seaplane approach.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If it&rsquo;s only Dan,&rdquo; MacGregor breathed.</p>
<p>There came the sound of rushing feet. Apparently
every little brown man on the boat
had heard those motors. They came swarming
onto the deck.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If it&rsquo;s Dan MacMillan,&rdquo; said MacGregor,
&ldquo;there&rsquo;s sure to be someone with him.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_219">[219]</div>
<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;ll be looking for us,&rdquo; said Rusty.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, and we&rsquo;ll have to find a way to let
them know we&rsquo;re here,&rdquo; Johnny added.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That,&rdquo; said MacGregor, &ldquo;is going to be
hard, with all these.&rdquo; His glance swept the
brown throng.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tell you what!&rdquo; Johnny exclaimed. &ldquo;Rusty
and I might do a little boxing bout. There&rsquo;s
sure to be someone on the plane who knows
us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And they&rsquo;ll recognize you by your actions,&rdquo;
MacGregor agreed. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a capital idea. I&rsquo;ll
go for the gloves.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And so it happened that, as the seaplane
flew over the ship, circled, then dipping low,
passed within a hundred feet, those in it witnessed
a strange sight&mdash;two white youngsters
staging a boxing match for the benefit of a
host of little brown men, who, truth to tell,
gave them scant attention.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I only hope they recognized us,&rdquo; said Johnny,
throwing his gloves on the deck.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You and me too,&rdquo; said Rusty. &ldquo;Anyway,&rdquo;
she laughed, &ldquo;that&rsquo;s one time I didn&rsquo;t knock
you out.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_220">[220]</div>
<p>Whatever impression this little drama may
have made upon the occupants of the seaplane,
the effect of the appearance of the seaplane on
the little brown men was apparent at once.
On every face as the seaplane went winging
away MacGregor read consternation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;re afraid,&rdquo; he grumbled low to his
young companions. &ldquo;Down deep in their hearts
they are afraid.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What will they do now?&rdquo; Rusty asked
anxiously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;re already doin&rsquo; it,&rdquo; said MacGregor,
calling attention to the rush and bustle on
board. &ldquo;Puttin&rsquo; the ship in shape. It wouldn&rsquo;t
surprise me if they weighed anchor within the
hour. And if they do, me lassie,&rdquo; he added,
&ldquo;you may be lookin&rsquo; on them Oriental cities
within a week, for they&rsquo;ll be headin&rsquo; straight
for home.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh-o,&rdquo; Rusty breathed. But she said never
a word.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_221">[221]</div>
<p class="tb">On that same morning in Smokey Joe&rsquo;s
cabin Lawrence was up before the wee small
hours had passed. After one good look at the
sea, which was still rolling high, he dashed
back into the cabin to find Blackie staring at
him wide awake.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Black-Blackie,&rdquo; he stammered. &ldquo;I&mdash;I hate
to disturb you. But&mdash;but that blue bear&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know.&rdquo; Blackie sat up. &ldquo;Three peaks, a
look and a right smart ho, hum.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Blackie! It&rsquo;s terribly important. Just think!
A little blue bear. The only one in captivity,
if we get him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know.&rdquo; Blackie slid out of his bunk.
&ldquo;Get the fire going. Put the coffee pot on.
We&rsquo;ll be off in a half hour.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, think&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Put the coffee on!&rdquo; Blackie roared.</p>
<p>After tacking an old shirt to a pole as a
signal of distress to any boat that might pass
and instructing Smokey Joe to be on the lookout,
Blackie drew a rough map, showing
where, according to Smokey&rsquo;s direction, the
bear&rsquo;s cave might be found. After that he led
the way over the first &ldquo;peak.&rdquo;</p>
<p>These peaks were, they discovered, mere
ridges. The distance was, in reality, much
shorter than they had thought.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_222">[222]</div>
<p>&ldquo;This is the place,&rdquo; Lawrence said, an hour
and a half later. &ldquo;It must be.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is,&rdquo; Blackie agreed. &ldquo;There are the two
scrub spruce trees with Smokey&rsquo;s blaze on
them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And there&rsquo;s the cave!&rdquo; Lawrence was
greatly excited.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not much of a cave,&rdquo; said Blackie. &ldquo;Might
be quite some bear at that. Wait.&rdquo;</p>
<p>With a small hatchet he hacked away at a
dry spruce knot until he had a pitch-filled
torch. This, with the aid of some dry shavings,
he lighted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now,&rdquo; he breathed. &ldquo;Give me one of the
ropes. We&rsquo;ll have to manage to tangle him
up somehow. I&rsquo;ll lead the way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Al-all right,&rdquo; Lawrence&rsquo;s tongue was dry.</p>
<p>The floor of the dark grotto was strewn
with pebbles. To walk without making a noise
was impossible.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wait! Listen!&rdquo; Lawrence whispered
when they had covered some twenty paces.</p>
<p>As they paused, they caught a low hissing
sound.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Snakes,&rdquo; the boy suggested.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_223">[223]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Not here. Too cold. It&rsquo;s the bear. Get
your rope ready.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Slowly, cautiously they moved forward.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There! There are his eyes.&rdquo; Two balls of
fire appeared directly before them.</p>
<p>And then things began to happen. A low
snarl was followed by the sound of scattered
pebbles. Blackie was hit by the rushing bear
and bowled over like a ten pin. But Lawrence,
quick as a cat, saw a hairy head, aimed a short
swing and let go his rope.</p>
<p>Next instant he was shouting: &ldquo;Blackie!
Quick! Help! I got him! I got him!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The husky little blue bear dragged them
both to the very entrance of the cave. There,
panting and tearing at the rope, he paused to
glare at them. The rope was drawn tight
about his shoulders with one foreleg through
the loop.</p>
<p>Blackie, who was both fast and strong,
made quick work of what remained to be
done. Fifteen minutes later, carrying the live
bear slung between them on a pole, they headed
for the cabin.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_224">[224]</div>
<p>To their great joy, as they neared the cabin,
they saw one of Red McGee&rsquo;s gill-net boats
awaiting them in the little bay. Smokey Joe
had flagged it down.</p>
<p>After a hasty, &ldquo;Thank you and goodbye&rdquo; to
Smokey, they tossed their priceless captive
into the after cabin of the stout, little motor-boat
to head straight away over a rolling sea
toward still more adventure, of quite a different
nature.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_225">[225]</div>
<h2 id="c24"><span class="small">CHAPTER XXIV</span>
<br />OVERTAKING A SHADOW</h2>
<p>Once again it was night. The wind had
gone down with the sun. The sea was
calm. On board the Oriental ship there was a
strained air of tense expectancy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t understand what&rsquo;s keepin&rsquo; &rsquo;em
here,&rdquo; MacGregor said in a low tone to his
young companions. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s plain that they&rsquo;re
scared stiff of that seaplane. Looks like they&rsquo;d
heave anchor and be away any minute. And
if they do&mdash;&rdquo; There was no need to finish.
Both Johnny and Rusty knew that this would
mean a trip to the Orient under circumstances
stranger than any fiction.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They seem to be waiting for something,&rdquo;
said Johnny.</p>
<p>This was true. All the little brown men not
stationed at posts of duty were standing along
the rail looking away toward the distant
shores that were lost in the night.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_226">[226]</div>
<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;ll be back,&rdquo; MacGregor said, thinking
of the men on the seaplane. &ldquo;Looks like
it&rsquo;s a race against time. But what are they
waiting for?&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was not long until they should know. As
they stood there, nerves a-tingle, listening, a
distant confusion of noises came to them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If there were a war,&rdquo; said MacGregor, &ldquo;I&rsquo;d
say it was rifle and machine-gun fire.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This notion was too fantastic to be seriously
considered. But what was it?</p>
<p>Second by second the sound increased in
volume. &ldquo;Can this be what they&rsquo;re looking
for?&rdquo; Johnny asked.</p>
<p>If so, these little men welcomed it in a
strange manner. Short, sharp commands were
given. Scores of men went into frenzied action.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look!&rdquo; Rusty gripped Johnny&rsquo;s arm.
&ldquo;They&rsquo;re lowering my boat into the water.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And it&rsquo;s got gas in the tank. All ready to
turn over and start. If only&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s motors we&rsquo;re hearin&rsquo;,&rdquo; MacGregor
broke in. &ldquo;A thunderin&rsquo; lot of &rsquo;em! I shouldn&rsquo;t
wonder&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_227">[227]</div>
<p>&ldquo;MacGregor,&rdquo; Rusty seized his arm, &ldquo;our
boat is in the water. They are all crowding
the rail again. This may be our chance.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So it may,&rdquo; the old man agreed. &ldquo;Follow
me. Not a sound!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll get Kopkina,&rdquo; offered Johnny. &ldquo;I just
saw him on deck.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dodging behind a life-raft Rusty and MacGregor
went scurrying along in the dark and
Johnny and Kopkina soon joined them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&mdash;it&rsquo;s just here,&rdquo; Rusty whispered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&mdash;we need a rope ladder,&rdquo; Johnny exclaimed
low.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here&rsquo;s one,&rdquo; came in MacGregor&rsquo;s cheering
voice. &ldquo;Let her over easy now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now,&rdquo; he breathed. &ldquo;Over you go.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The speed with which they went down that
ladder, all but treading on one another&rsquo;s fingers,
would have done credit to the U. S.
Navy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now I&rsquo;ll cut her loose,&rdquo; said MacGregor.
&ldquo;All right, Rusty, turn her over.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The fly-wheel whirled. The splendid motor
began a low put-put-put. They were away
into the dark.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_228">[228]</div>
<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;d have trouble findin&rsquo; us,&rdquo; MacGregor
murmured.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But listen!&rdquo; Johnny exclaimed.</p>
<p>The sound of many motors had doubled and
redoubled. Just as they were about to swing
around the prow of the ship, something long,
dark and silent shot past them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Shadow!&rdquo; Johnny exclaimed.</p>
<p>It was true, this was the Shadow. But at
last the Shadow was not going to escape.
After it thundered a powerful speedboat and
as she shot past them the excited trio saw a
burst of flames and caught the rat-tat-tat of a
machine gun.</p>
<p>This was followed instantly by a wild
scream from the Shadow which sounded very
much like a sign of surrender. At the same
time the sea seemed fairly ablaze with lights
from many boats.</p>
<p>Johnny&rsquo;s head was in a whirl. What was
happening? Without knowing why she did
it, Rusty seized him by the arm and held him
tight while she screamed, &ldquo;Johnny! It&rsquo;s wonderful!
Wonderful!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_229">[229]</div>
<p>What had happened may be quickly told.
When Blackie and his crew failed to return,
and Rusty as well, there had been consternation
about the cannery. There was little use
searching Bristol Bay in a fog. When, however,
Dan MacMillan appeared in his seaplane,
they went into action. Red McGee climbed
into the cockpit and they were away. They
had circled for an hour when they sighted the
Oriental ship.</p>
<p>As they flew over it Red McGee experienced
no difficulty in getting the unusual signals
Johnny and Rusty had set up for him. He
recognized the boxing forms of both Rusty
and Johnny.</p>
<p>Realizing that his daughter would be on
board that ship only against her will, he went
into a wild rage. He demanded that the seaplane
be landed close to the ship and that he
be allowed to &ldquo;tackle the whole lot of &rsquo;em
single-handed.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_230">[230]</div>
<p>To this young MacMillan, would not consent;
for, in the first place, the sea was too
rough for a landing and in the second, he was
not willing as he later expressed it, &ldquo;To see a
good man commit suicide by tackling a hundred
Orientals single-handed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He had flown back to their base. By the
time they reached the cannery, Red had cooled
off.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I want every last boat gassed up for an
emergency run,&rdquo; he commanded. &ldquo;Any of you
men that have guns, get &rsquo;em loaded and ready.
There&rsquo;s a couple o&rsquo; whale-guns up at my cabin.
You, Pete and Dan, get &rsquo;em an&rsquo; see that
they&rsquo;re loaded. We&rsquo;ll show &rsquo;em.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They were about ready for a start when
Blackie and his men arrived on the scene.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Blackie,&rdquo; Red exploded, &ldquo;they&rsquo;ve got Rusty
and your boy, Johnny. They&rsquo;re holdin&rsquo; &rsquo;em
captive. Come on! We&rsquo;ll start a war!&rdquo;</p>
<p>For once, Blackie did not say, &ldquo;No.&rdquo; After
they had turned the small, blue bear loose in
a sheet-metal tool-shed he climbed into Dan
MacMillan&rsquo;s speed boat, dragging Red and
Lawrence with him, and they were away.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_231">[231]</div>
<p>It was this speedboat that had spied the
Shadow. They had given it chase and had,
as you have seen, at last, after sending a volley
of machine-gun bullets across its bow,
overhauled it.</p>
<p>The Shadow was the very craft that had
been awaited by the Oriental ship. Had it put
in an appearance two hours sooner, the ship
must surely have weighed anchor and our
story might have been much longer. As it was,
the Orientals were destined to wait a long,
long time before lifting the Shadow on deck,
if at all.</p>
<p>While Johnny and Rusty looked and listened,
the whole cannery fleet, every small
deck bristling with guns, surrounded the ship.</p>
<p>Having overhauled the Shadow, Blackie
placed it in charge of another craft, then came
gliding in alongside the <i>Krazy Kat</i>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;MacGregor,&rdquo; he said in a husky voice,
&ldquo;tell me what happened.&rdquo; MacGregor told
him. Hardly had he finished when a small
motor launch carrying three little brown officers
arrived. The officers were fairly aglow
with gold and braid.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A thousand pardons,&rdquo; their leader began.
He was allowed to go no farther.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_232">[232]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Listen!&rdquo; Blackie stood up. He was dressed
in corduroy trousers and a leather jacket. His
face was working strangely.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Listen,&rdquo; he repeated. &ldquo;No apologies, not
a thousand, nor even one. I&rsquo;ll do the talking.&rdquo;
His voice was low. &ldquo;I know why you&rsquo;re here.
To catch our fish. You sank our boat. You
have an hour to get your ship headed out of
Bristol Bay. We&rsquo;ll take that Shadow of yours
with us. We caught her lifting nets inside the
three-mile limit. That makes her a fair prize.</p>
<p>&ldquo;As to the sinking of the <i>Stormy Petrel</i>, I
shall make a complete report. The matter shall
be taken up by our diplomats.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I might add, for your further information,
that a law is now before our Congress making
Bristol Bay United States waters, open to our
fishermen alone. It will pass. If you care to
come back next year we will meet you with
three destroyers.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And now, gentlemen,&rdquo; he doffed a ragged
cap, &ldquo;I bid you good-night.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Clicking their heels, without a single apology,
the officers saluted, then the power boat
lost itself in the shadows.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_233">[233]</div>
<h2 id="c25"><span class="small">CHAPTER XXV</span>
<br />&ldquo;BILL&rdquo; RETURNS</h2>
<p>&ldquo;Rusty, my child,&rdquo; said Red McGee,
springing aboard the <i>Krazy Kat</i> as soon
as the Orientals were gone, &ldquo;are you all
right?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Never better,&rdquo; Rusty laughed. &ldquo;And never
half so excited. I&mdash;I&rsquo;m all right,&rdquo; she added,
&ldquo;except that I&rsquo;ll have to grow a new crop of
curls.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Curls,&rdquo; Red chuckled. &ldquo;They&rsquo;re not very
necessary. Not even for a girl.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Going back with us in the speed boat?&rdquo; he
asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No-o, if you don&rsquo;t mind,&rdquo; she hesitated.
&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve been together so long, the three of us,
MacGregor, Johnny, and I, that I&mdash;I think
we&rsquo;d like to follow you back in the <i>Krazy Kat</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;O.K.,&rdquo; Red agreed. &ldquo;Kopkina, suppose you
come with me. I want to thank you for what
you&rsquo;ve done for us. Now let&rsquo;s get going.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_234">[234]</div>
<p>Already the Oriental ship that had never
been welcome was slipping out into the night.</p>
<p>On the way back Johnny and Rusty spent
most of their time studying the stars and the
moon. Just what they read there only they
will ever know.</p>
<p>The secret of the Shadow was found to be
quite simple, as most secrets are. It was a
long, low craft without deck, cabins, rails or
riggings. Powered by large storage batteries,
it was able to slip in close to shore, set a three-mile-long
net at night and lift it in the morning.
The fish were rushed to other motor-boats
outside the three-mile zone and were
then carried to the floating cannery.</p>
<p>After installing a gasoline motor, Blackie
used the Shadow for sea patrol. No demand
for the return of the craft was made. Needless
to say, the duties of Blackie, MacGregor,
Johnny and Lawrence were exceedingly light
for the remainder of the season.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_235">[235]</div>
<p>The small blue bear throve on fish-cleanings
and other scraps. He was fat and friendly
when at last the boys headed for Seward and
Matanuska Valley. At Seward they left him
in the care of a friend until they could come in
a small truck and cart him home.</p>
<p>At the cabin in the valley Johnny and Lawrence
were given an uproarious welcome.</p>
<p>One thing surprised them&mdash;the Professor
was back. &ldquo;I am waiting for Bill,&rdquo; he explained.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bill! Who&rsquo;s he?&rdquo; Lawrence asked. &ldquo;Oh!&rdquo;
he exclaimed. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s the man who built the
shelter and left a note saying he was coming
back. Let me see&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Today,&rdquo; said the Professor. &ldquo;And here he
is now.&rdquo; A smiling young giant with a full
red beard came tramping down the road.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bill, did you get one?&rdquo; the Professor demanded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; Bill&rsquo;s smile faded. &ldquo;I did my best. I
got the head and hide of one, that&rsquo;s all. Had
to kill him, or lose him. I&mdash;I&rsquo;m sorry.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A whole year,&rdquo; the Professor groaned.
&ldquo;And never a bear.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A bear!&rdquo; Johnny exclaimed. &ldquo;Surely there
are bears a-plenty.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_236">[236]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Not that kind,&rdquo; the Professor corrected.
&ldquo;I want the kind we talked about once, a glacier
bear. Nothing else counts.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, a glacier bear!&rdquo; Lawrence laughed
happily. &ldquo;Is that all you want? I have one
coming up on a truck from Seward. It should
be here any time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just like that!&rdquo; Bill dropped weakly down
upon a stump. &ldquo;A whole year. Ice, snow,
blizzards, glaciers, hunger, a whole year. Never
a bear. And now this boy calmly says, &lsquo;I&rsquo;ve
got one coming up.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Such,&rdquo; said the professor, &ldquo;is the luck of
the chase.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was time for Bill to satisfy his craving
for a &ldquo;real feed.&rdquo; Then the truck arrived.</p>
<p>The Professor and Bill gave one look at the
little blue glacier bear. Then, for sheer joy,
they fell into each other&rsquo;s arms.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you want for him?&rdquo; the Professor
demanded at last.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A tractor,&rdquo; said Lawrence.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The best in the settlement!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Titan.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_237">[237]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Agreed and for good measure, a gang
plow, a harrow, two drums of gas and three
log chains.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lawrence could not say a word. He could
only stand and stare. All his dreams had come
true in a moment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I only wish we might do better,&rdquo; the Professor
half apologized. &ldquo;But we&rsquo;ve spent a
great deal of money in the search. So-o, I&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think,&rdquo; said Lawrence, &ldquo;that you&rsquo;re a
very good sport. And&mdash;and we thank you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Three days later Johnny and Lawrence
were in Seward for a day with Blackie when
a trim power boat glided up to the dock.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hello, Johnny!&rdquo; came in a girl&rsquo;s voice. It
was Rusty.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come on down to Seattle with us,&rdquo; Red
McGee boomed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll show you a roarin&rsquo; good time, just to
celebrate the finest salmon season ever
known.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you say?&rdquo; Johnny turned to
Lawrence.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_238">[238]</div>
<p>&ldquo;You go,&rdquo; said Lawrence. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m a farmer
now. I&rsquo;ve got to stay with my crops, and I&rsquo;m
anxious to get started with the new tractor.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Johnny went. If there were further adventures
awaiting him at the end of that short
journey you may find them recorded in a book
called, <i>Sign of the Green Arrow</i>.</p>
